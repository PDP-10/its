Twenex Midas now kills itself (via PRARG) when done.  I think this will
only affect MIT users, but if any other site's exec recognises the same
PRARG options, ftp the file oz:ss:<sys.midas>TSRTNS.MID.232.

MIDAS does have this ability (FOO=BAR"), however it (and many other
such features) exist only for the ITS STINK relocatable format, rather
than the LINK format.  I am looking at what would be required to
provide functionality similar to STINK, but this is somewhat difficult as
there are a bunch of things that STINK format allows, which LINK doesn't,
so it requires really understanding what is going on in order to let only
the LINK-allowable things happen.  The person who did .DECREL originally
took the easy way out by requiring things to be assembled more or less
pseudo-absolutely.  I haven't given up, but it's tough going as very
little of the STINK format is documented.  Fortunately a lot of it is
extremely similar to LINK, and they are doubtless related far back in
the dim past.

One thing I've noticed MIDAS missing that MACRO has, is the ability to
have external symbols in equals (=).  This is quite handy and makes
writing modules easier.  Dunno how hard it would be to make MIDAS
generate the appropriate LINK record but it probably is worth it.

I have a few questions about some things I found in the MIDAS BUGS
file.  I seem to be in a mood to fix them, depending on the kind
of answers I get...

1. .FAS or .FASL?
	Some people claim that on TOPS-20, output files generated with
the .FASL pseudo-op should have the extension .FASL rather than .FAS.
Is this true?  Is this also true for TENEX?

2. TOPS-20 CCL?
	This purportedly no longer works for V3+.  Where do I find
out how it should work?  Should compatibility with V2- be retained?

3. MIDAS .INSRT library?
	I would like to provide a system-independent way of allowing
programs to .INSRT commonly used files.  For this purpose I am thinking
of adding a new pseudo called .INSLIB which would act exactly like
.INSRT with the difference that the device/directory names would default
to a place containing standard, public, or useful MIDAS .INSRT
packages.  This place can be defined on a per-system basis.  If it was
ever desired to change these defaults for a single assembly, this
could be done by giving an .INSLIB specification with an explicit
device/directory and no filename.  Comments welcomed.

4.  Others?
	If you have some ideas which have never been sent to
BUG-MIDAS, now is a good time, not because I plan to try doing
anything but because I am interested in seeing whether other people
have found undocumented bugs or have hidden wish lists.  I have a
loooong list of MIDAS ideas as well as bugs, which will be available
in MIDAS;IDEAS > (plus MIDAS BUGS), for those who care to avoid
reiteration.  The usual warning: very few such items ever
get implemented.

Yes, merge it (you can just point to it if you want to keep an OZ-specific
group)...

Latest version of MIDAS (not back on MC yet) fixes the various
problems with building new MIDASes.  I am currently
scanning MIDAS BUGS (archive of bug-midas mail) to see if there
are any interesting things that are easy to add before installing
it.

There's this list here... maybe it should be merged?  It's mostly to do
with 20-only stuff, usually OZ-only, like new packages and junk.
