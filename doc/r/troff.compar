.e
Unlimited length macro and register names.
.e
All ASCII characters can be used as text.  (Of course,
escape or quoting may be needed to write some characters.)
.e
Tracing mode for debugging.
.e
Control character mapping more reasonable and more precisely
defined.  Changing the control character mapping does not
interfere with previously-defined macros.
.e
Many built-in number registers and string registers.
.e
Lambda-binding of registers.  When used with the built-in
registers, this provides a convenient method for saving
and restoring states.
.e
Conditional and loop constructs.
.e
String operations.
.e
Up to 16 fonts.  (Fonts are actually font/size combinations;
there is no notion of separately changing point size.)
.e
Many error messages.  (Error messages go to the terminal;
formatted output always goes to a file.)
.e
Inline macro invocation.  Useful for equations.
.e
Operator precedence in expressions.
.e
Extra line-space provided automatically to compensate for
extra-tall characters.
.e
Non-integer line-spacing allowed (e.g. space-and-a-half).
.e
Explicit right indentation.
.e
Arbitrary number of named environments.
.e
Tabs, hpos, etc. refer to 2output* positions.
.e
Can expunge environments and registers.
.e
To delay the interpretation of a control character for 2n* readings,
2n* backslashes are used, rather than 22n*-1.

.ns
.e
Well-modularized, with device and system dependencies factored
out.  Currently runs on 2 systems (PDP11 UNIX and PDP10 ITS)
and supports 3 devices (printing, XGP, and Varian).
.e
Long names used internally.  (The long names are translated to
short ones where necessary by #defines.  The C preprocessor must
be changed to recognize 16 characters in identifiers to support
this usage.)

.ns
.e
No hyphenation.
.e
No diverted output.  (However, facilities are provided to do
local two-pass processing.)
.e
No direct to terminal output.  (A file is always produced.
A separate program can be used to print the file on a
terminal, pausing at each page and adding extra blank lines
to fill out pages.)
.e
No line numbering.
.e
No fixed-width mode.
.e
No input-line-count traps.
.e
No special support for ligatures or special names for
special characters.
.e
No transparent throughput mode.
