                          Useful Console Commands


Talking to the 8080:

		Start talking to the 8080
		Stops whatever the 8080 is doing
		Stop talking to the 8080


Multiple commands can be given on a command line separated by commas.  If
the RP command is the last command in the line, then the line will be
repeated.  It stops when you type any character.  An argument to RP causes
it to repeat the command roughly that many times.  Useful are: "PM,RP",
"SI,RP", "EN,RP".


Booting the machine:

BT		BooT
		Resets the machine and boots from disk.
		Normally this loads and starts DSKDMP.

MT		MagTape boot
		Resets the machine and boots from magtape.

DS		Disk Select
		Selects which disk drive to boot from.

MS		Magtape Select
		Selects which tape drive to boot from.


Debugging PDP-10 code:

ST pc		STart
		DDT starts at 774000.
		DSKDMP starts at 777700.

SH		SHutdown  (Stop! Hold!)
		Like raising switch 0 on a machine that has one.

HA		HAlt

CO		COntinue

SI		Single Instruction

LA addr		Load Address

DM data		Deposit Memory

DN data		Deposit Next

EM [addr]	Examine Memory

EN		Examine Next

EX inst		EXecute instruction

ZM		Zero Memory
		This is VERY slow.  It starts with low addresses, so ZM
		followed by  is good enough to clear most memory that
		you care about.


Debugging microcode:

SM [upc]	Start Microcode
		0 (the default) is the normal starting address.  1 just
		writes a halt status block. 

MR		Master Reset
		Resets everything (whatever that is).

CH		Clock Halt
		Stops the microcode in its tracks.

CS		Clock Start
		Start the microcode up again.

CP [steps]	Clock Pulse
		Single steps the microcode one or many steps.

EJ		Examine Jumps
		Prints current upc and how the next upc is being computed.

PM		Pulse Machine
		Like "CP,EJ".

TR upc		TRace
		Like "PM,RP" except it stops when the current upc gets to
		the specified value.  Also uses twice as much paper.

TE [state]	Timer Enable
		"TE 0" turns the timer off.  Makes it possible to single
		step the microcode with paging enabled without looping
		taking timer interrupts.  "TE 1" turns the timer on.  Just
		"TE" tells you what its state is.

CE [state]	Cache Enable
		Turns the cache on and off.

TP [state]	Traps & Paging
		Turns traps and paging on and off.


Halt Status Block:

[ Note that the DEC microcode wants to write the halt status block 
  starting at 376000. ]

500:	MAG		506:	BRX	       514:	PI
501:	PC		507:	ONE	       515:	XWD1
502:	HR		510:	EBR	       516:	T0
503:	AR		511:	UBR	       517:	T1
504:	ARX		512:	MASK	       520:	VMA
505:	BR		513:	FLG

It does -not- work to start the machine and read the halt status block
using DDT, you have to read it using the 8080.


Halt Codes:

     0:	Power Up			   102:	Bad Interrupt Table Pointer
     1:	Halt Instruction		  1000:	Bad BWRITE Function
     2:	Halted by 8080			  1004:	Bad NICOND Dispatch
   100:	I/O Page Fail			  1005:	Failed Multiply Self-test
   101:	Bad Interrupt Instruction	777777:	Halted after "SM 1" command
