This directory contains KS10 specific files for ITS.  It contains:
The microcode assembler, microcode source files, etc.
KSDEFS and other KS10-specific documentation and definition files.
The new salvager NSALV.
KSFEDR, the 8080 front-end filesystem manipulation program.
MTBOOT, the KS10 boot tape writing program.
The MINI36 server, used by NSALV to retrieve files over Chaosnet.
Etc.

The KSHACK directory on MC no longer contains the canonical versions of
these files.  The KSHACK directory on AI is now the official KS10 hacking
directory.  -Alan 12/30/85
