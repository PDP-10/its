                           WHAT TO DO IF AI CRASHES

*******************************************************************************
* Before following these directions, please try to find a system hacker to    *
* take a look at the corpse first.					      *
*									      *
* If you do -anything- about a crashed ITS, leave an explanation in the log   *
* book next to the system console.  Include the date and time, your name,     *
* what the problem was, what you did, and anything else relevant.  And please *
* make it legible; three lines of random scrawls can't help the hackers fix   *
* the problem.								      *
*******************************************************************************

                               THE SIMPLEST CASE
In the most common sort of crash, AI will type a bug message and go to Exec
DDT.  For example:
    PI LEVEL 7 BUGHALT.  FIND A WIZARD OR CONSIDER TAKING A CRASH DUMP.
    THE SYSTEM HAS CRASHED AND CANNOT BE REVIVED WITHOUT EXPERT ATTENTION.
    IF YOU CAN'T FIND HELP, RELOAD THE SYSTEM.
    YOU ARE NOW IN DDT.
    BUGPC/   CAIA PCLSR+3   $Q-1/   PUSHJ P,BUGNIL

If the message says that the bug is "proceedable", you can try typing:
    $P
to revive the system.  If this works, be glad you don't have to read the rest
of this notice; however, you should still leave a note in the log book.

                               LESS THAN SIMPLE
If the system cannot be revived, it must be reloaded.  To reload, you must get
to DSKDMP.  Type:
    $U
to leave Exec DDT and start DSKDMP.  When DSKDMP starts up it announces itself
by saying:
     DSKDMP
If DSKDMP has something to complain about, it will type a error message; its
error messages are explained on the summary of DSKDMP commands taped to AI.  If
you don't understand (or like) what DSKDMP is telling you, stop; let someone
who does understand check it out.

                                  CRASH DUMPS
Before reloading, you may want to take a crash dump.  Crash dumps are
recommended if anything unusual was happening before the system crashed, or if
the remains look funny.  To take a crash dump, get into DSKDMP and type:
    D$CRASH;<fn1> <fn2><cr>
where <fn1> <fn2> is somehow descriptive of the problem; AI will linefeed when
the crash has been dumped.  You can list the CRASH directory by typing:
    U$CRASH;
to see what filenames are already used.  If you take a crash dump, send mail to
Bug-ITS giving the filename you used.

                                 RELOADING ITS
Look at AI's "Very Small Bulletin Board" envelope on the front of the system
console.  The punch card in front will list which version of ITS is supposed to
be running.  If, for instance, it says "NITS", then to reload AI, type:
    .;NITS<cr>
This will cause DSKDMP to find the file DSK:.;@ NITS, load it into core, and
start it in Exec DDT -- thus, you will be talking to Exec DDT again, which will
linefeed to indicate it's ready for you.

Now check for any special instructions someone might have left about patching
ITS before starting it.  Typically, a patch will appear as a few cryptic
commands scrawled on a scrap of paper stuffed into the VSBB in front on the
punch cards, which must be typed to Exec DDT before you proceed further.  If
you find such instructions, but can't figure out what they mean, stop now.

To start ITS, type:
    $G
to Exec DDT.  ITS starts by running the Salvager over the filesystem, which
causes the disk to make noise -- don't worry, that's supposed to happen -- and
prints a series of messages to indicate its progress.  If the Salvager finds
anything terribly wrong with the filesystem, it will refuse to let you bring
the system back up.  If this happens, give up and find a hacker.

Next, ITS pokes around to see if there are any surprising holes in its memory.
If it finds any, it will ask if they are OK.  If there is a note in the VSBB
predicting the holes exactly, answer affirmatively; otherwise it is time to
find a system hacker.

Now ITS checks whether it knows the time.  If it doesn't, it tries to find the
current time from other machines on the local network.  This may not work; if
it doesn't, AI will print an attention-getting message (including feeps) as it
comes up.  In this case, you must log in and run the PDSET program.

                                 RUNNING PDSET
If ITS tells you to run PDSET, you might as well does this from the system
console.  So type:
    
and after AI greets you, type:
    :PDSET<cr>
to run the PDSET program.  PDSET starts by warning you that what it does is
potentially dangerous.  To set the date and time type:
    yymmddD
    hhmmssT
    !.
where "yymmdd" is the date ("850520" for May 20, 1985) and "hhmmss" is the time
in 24-hour time ("145900" for 2:59 PM).  At the instant you type the ".", PDSET
will set the time to what you specified.

To leave PDSET type:
    Q
and then log out:
    $$U

                                  IF AI HALTS
If the processor halts, the 8080 front-end will print a halt code and a PC.
These will look something like:
    %HLTD/000001  PC/704000,,071101
Write these numbers in the log book.  Also, if you take a crash dump, mention
these numbers in the mail you send to Bug-ITS.

You should now be talking to the 8080 front-end.  To check this, type a
linefeed or two; you should see the prompt:
    KS10> 
Now type:
    ST 777700<cr>
and the 8080 will try to start DSKDMP.  If this works, DSKDMP will announce
itself, and you should go back to the middle of "Less Than Simple" and proceed
from there.

If DSKDMP does not start up, cold boot the machine.

                                 COLD BOOTING
Push the white "BOOT" switch on the front of AI.  This should initialize
everything, and load and start DSKDMP.  DSKDMP will announce itself by typing:
     DSKDMP
If nothing happens, make sure that some loser hasn't set the white "LOCK"
switch, also be sure that the "WRITE PROTECT" switch on the disk isn't set.
Now go back to "Reloading ITS" and proceed from there.

                 ITS IS CLEARLY BROKEN, BUT IT'S STILL RUNNING
Are you sure?  Make sure it is really the case that nobody is getting any work
done.  Check people on both network terminals and hardwired lines.  If you are
certain, then type:
    
to get the attention of the 8080 front-end.  It should prompt you with:
    KS10> 
(if it doesn't, make sure the white "LOCK" switch hasn't accidently been set).
Type:
    SH<cr>
to make the 8080 ask ITS to stop and go to Exec DDT.  If this works, AI will
print a PI LEVEL 7 BUG message; go back to "Less Than Simple" and proceed from
there.

If ITS ignores the 8080's request, type "" again and this time follow it 
with:
    HA<cr> 
This should force the processor to halt, so go back to "If AI Halts" and
proceed from there.  If this does not work, cold boot the machine.

                                  CALLING DEC
If you determine that the machine needs to be serviced by DEC, call them at
895-5711.  Tell them we have "2020 system number 84019009N" and describe the
problem.  If they claim they can't find the system in their records, be
insistent; the field service people can find the machine even if the phone
answering people can't.  They will ask for the name and phone number of someone
to contact; it doesn't matter whose you give them -- the field service people
know MIT well enough that they don't need those.

                               BRINGING AI DOWN
You should only bring AI down with good reason, e.g. the machine room is over
80, or it's time for PM.  First, log in:
    <your uname here>$U
(for instance, "DEC$U" if you're here to run PM.)  Then run
    :LOCK
It will prompt
    _
type
    nDOWN
where "n" is an integer not less than five; this will make AI bring itself down
in "n" minutes (LOCK sees numbers in octal only).  This interval must be at
least five minutes to give people a chance to clean up.  LOCK will ask you for
a message explaining why you're bringing AI down; type in a short explanation
and include your UNAME (so the users know who to blame) and end with
    
Then
    Q
to get out of LOCK and
    $$U
to log out.  Then just wait.
