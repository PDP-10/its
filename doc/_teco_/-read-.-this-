THIS DIRECTORY STORES COMMON TECO MACROS.  DO NOT DELETE.

IF YOU WISH TO PERMANENTLY STORE A TECO-RELATED FILE(S) ON THIS
DIRECTORY, THEN ENTER THE FILE NAME(S) BELOW IN THE

ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO SURVIVE.

DO NOT ALTER ANY FILES ON THIS DIRECTORY WITHOUT FIRST
RECEIVING PERMISSION FROM ONE OF THE PEOPLE MAINTAINING THE FILE.

THESE FILES ARE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC USE, BUT USE
AT YOUR OWN RISK.

TXJ		; XGP TEXT JUSTIFIER FILES.txj is like tj6 except
		it has primitives for equations and
		is smart about vertical heights. in addition it 
		interfaces well with teco allowing arbitrary teco
		macros to be executed during justification.  thus
		abbreviations, special hacks, etc. are easy to
		implement.
