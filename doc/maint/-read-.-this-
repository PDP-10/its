This directory contains diagnostics.  This file contains some theories
and guesses.

The PART * files are probably for KA10 and KL10.  Some timestamps are
from 1971 which is long before the KL10.  Others are from 1975 which
is right about when MIT would have gotten their first KL10.  Some of
the .OLD files check KA10 behavior, such as K.OLD which runs an
overflowing AOBJN.  KS10 passes all files except PART K.  To run the
diagnostics, load and run PART A; it will run the next part
automatically until PART M which starts over.

The PDP6 * files are for the PDP-6.

The SAV files are KL10 & KI10 basic instruction diagnostics and can be
run with DECUUO.  These work on a KA10: DEKAA, DEKAB, DEKAC, DEKAE,
and DEKAF.  DEKAD and DEKAG work on a KS10, but not DEKAF.

TST342 displays all characters supported by the Type 342 character generator.
