This directory is used by the ITS mailing system; that is, the QMAIL
and Satellite programs.  Please DO NOT EVER delete any file from this
directory; also, the programs therein should not be modified without
first consulting BUG-MAIL.  If GC'ing must be done on program files,
do not delete either the most recent or most ancient file (which is
usually around for a reason).  Under some circumstances, BURNUP dumps
can gobble up gross amounts of space.  In this situation, flushing
intermediate dumps (never first or last) is OK.

The files with particular automated functions are:
   ID  69	creation date indicates when current STATS file began.
 FROM  INQUIR	creation date indicates when current INQUIR file written.
 LOCK  UNIQUE	page shared by all comsats for lock-switch functions
 LIST  MASTER   master message list
 LIST  QUEUE	queue information file
 LIST  REMIND   reminders list file
 LIST  EQVS	equivalence table data "compiled" from NAMES
 LISTS MSGS	holds text of messages in queue.

BURNUP	binary dumps of satellites that detect fatal errors.
COMSAT	the binary actually loaded and run.
MAIL	input to the satellite.
NAMES	the ASCII form of the equivalence tables.
STATS	statistics and running commentary kept by the satellite.

	there also exist parallel sets for experimental versions:
XLOCK XQUEUE XREF XMAIL XNAMES XSTATS etc.
