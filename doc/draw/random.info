HOW TO DO IT -- PC CARDS

Start here when you have completely finished wiring
your pc card.

	You are now in the PC program. You must now generate
4 plot files. The 2 outer planes (component and solder)
and the 2 inner planes (power and ground).
You should try to use the following form for plot filenames.
End the name with "C" for component, "S" for solder, "P"
for power, and "G" for ground.
	To generate the component and solder plane plots
get on the appropriate side and say <ctrl><meta>W. Then
type the filename.
	Now for inner planes. If you want anything but
clearances in your inner planes, STOP and see RPH. Otherwise
you now type INNER<cr> to the extended scanner. This deletes
all lines and points except dip pins and feed throughs, and
sets the pad type for these to 2 (clearances). Currently the
plane connections aren't indicated by the absence of pads.
	To make the inner plane plots, use the extended mode
PPLOT command, which asks for the plane number, then the
filename. The plane number is the same as the one you gave
to attach to the plane in the first place.
DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 23

MORE PC CARDS -- PCP
	Now you have 4 plot files (if not see RPH). Now run PCP.

	The following indicates program prompts in upper case,
then a description of your response in loser case.
It is suggested that you run PCP on a teletype when doing a TRW
run, and save the output for transfering to a planning sheet.

When program starts up, it asks:

OUTPUT MODE(S)?

	If you respond "?", the following list will be typed:

CHAR	EFFECT
?	TYPE THIS LIST
C	CALCOMP OUTPUT
F	FR80 OUTPUT
X	XGP OUTPUT
G	GO DIRECTLY TO X PROG
W	SPOOL X OUTPUT, "R XS" WHEN ALL DONE
S	ENABLE RESTART CAPABILITY
R	ROTATE PLOT
T	TRW OUTPUT
M	MAP RETICLES
A	ADD SYMBOL DEFINITIONS
D	MAKE DRILL TAPE FIRST TIME THROUGH

	You may type any of the characters in the first column
	all on one line, the program will warn you of any
	conflicting modes.

	Here is a brief description of each of the modes:

?	Obvious

C	This causes a plot to be made on the calcomp plotter.

F	This causes a file to be written on the current area
	with the extension 'F80'. This file when copied onto
	a magtape (see description, end of page), will produce
	FR80 microfilm of the pc card.

X	Instead of driving the calcomp plotter, plotter commands
	go into a file with the extension 'PLX'. This file when
	processed by the 'X' program will produce XGP output of
	your pc card.

G	This specifies that when the first plot is done, the
	program should link directly to the 'X' program, which
	will then produce the XGP output.

W	This causes output to the XGP to be generated and 'X' to
	be run, but 'X' writes its output on the disk again. Later
	when you have run all your cards through 'PCP', you run
	'XS' which finds, prints on the XGP, and deletes all the
	temporary files. This saves time and paper on the XGP.

DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 23-1

S	This command, intended for use exclusively with calcomp
	plotter output, plots a cross 2" above the intial pen
	position, and during the processing of the plot,
	accasionally saves a core image (it will ask how often to
	do this). If for some reason you must start over, mearly
	position the bullseye on the pen carraige over the cross
	and run file called "PLTSAV.DMP", which will continue
	the plot from the place where it left off.

R	This will cause the plot to be rotated 90 degrees CCW.

T	This will write a file with the extension 'MAG'. When
	copied to a magtape (see next page) the tape can be
	sent to TRW in L.A. and plotted on film on their gerber
	plotter system. This also generates a 'LOG' file which
	should be XGP'd and stuck in the plot log book.

M	When this mode is selected, the program will ask for
	pad types which want to be the same wheel pos as another
	pad type, or the same as some position not accessible by
	pad types directly.

A	This causes PCP to accept extra symbol definitions other
	than the standard ones.

D	A drill tape file is made from the first file processed.

If you select both "T" and "D" modes, the trw output will be a drill
plot. That is, no lines, text, or pads are drawn and donut pads are
plotted at the location of each drill hole.

If you selected the "T" output mode:

    and "M" mode,

		If you have a pad type in your pc card, and you want
		to use one of the standard reticles (i.e. nortronics
		target), this allows you to map the pad type into a
		different wheel position than usual. If you answer
		"Y", you are asked the following:

	RETICLE MAPPING LIVES FOR EVER IN THIS CORE IMAGE!
	PAD TYPE NUMBER?

		Here you respond with the pad type number which you
		set in the pc prog. If you respond <cr>, you get out.

	WHEEL POS?

		Now you tell which wheel position you wish selected
		for this pad type. Then you loop back to the pad
		type prompt.

    and "A" mode,

		If you are using any characters not in the TRW
		standard character set (see RPH for character
		set), say Y<cr>. If you say Y, the following
DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 23-2

		will be asked:
	SYMBOL DEFINITIONS LIVE FOR EVER (IN THIS CORE IMAGE).
	BE SURE TO MAKE A SKETCH OF THE SYMBOL INDICATING THE "D" CODE.
	D60?
		Type the single character for this code (no <cr>).
		Any previously assigned codes will be printed followed
		their character, then you will be asked to assign the
		first unassigned code. Type the character you used when
		you placed the text in the PC prog.
	D61?
		This will continue until you answer <cr>.

If you selected the "F" output mode:

	AT FR80 SCALE OF 3.7 FRAME IS ABOUT 22X17.
	FR80 SCALE*10 ?

		This is exactly what it seems, if your card is somewhat
		smaller than this, you may use a larger scale. Use AID
		to calculate the appropriate scale. <cr> will get you
		37 (scale of 3.7).

	FR80 FRAME IS 22X17.

		The frame size will be printed if you give a scale other than 37.

SCALE FACTOR?

	Scale of 1 is real size (you get this if you type <cr> alone).
	Don't use anything else if you are making a TRW plot or an FR80
	plot. This may be used to make detail plots.

POSITIVE X,Y OFFSET (IN INCHES, DECIMAL POINT OK!)?

	This must be used to generate TRW plot tapes, and CINCH
	drill tapes. Both systems have 0,0 at the lower left.
	The standard film we are using at TRW is 24 x 20 inches.
	Thus the offset should be 12,10<cr>. The CINCH drill frame
	size we will use is 20 x 20 inches, so use 10,10 for drill
	tape. If <cr> is typed, and you are making a TRW plot,
	12,10 will be used. Otherwise 0,0 is used.
	This offset is not used for FR80 output. FR80 output is
	centered automatically.

The preceeding information is asked only once every time the program
is started. The rest is asked in a loop starting here. When done type
^C (call).

FILENAME?

	Type the plot filename, default extension is "PCP".

CHAR	"M"	 HEIGHT
SCALE	CODE	(IN MILS)
0	M50	120
1	M51
2	M52
3	M53
DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 23-3

4	M54

	This controls the character size, the typeout actually
	stops at the end of each line, <cr> suppresses text
	of this scale. If this is a TRW tape, the height must be
	divisible by 15. Otherwise it must be divisible by 5.
	This number is the height and spacing of the characters
	of that scale. Scale 0 (M50) is used for the messages,
	which are plotted across the bottom of the film.
	If you respond with altmode, the rest of the char. size
	promts are suppressed.

PUT PEN AT 0,0.
LINES, TEXT, AND PADS MAX X= 0.000 MIN X= 0.000 MAX Y= 0.000 MIN Y= 0.000

	This information is calculated from the plot file, and does not
	include the card outline. If any of the numbers are abnormally
	large, STOP and get RPH immediately.

If this is a TRW plot tape the following is asked:

	OPERATOR MESSAGES, 40 CHARS PER LINE (MAX). END WITH <CR>.
	STANFORD A.I. PROJECT.	<ALREADY ON TAPE>

		This puts messages on the tape which are typed
		to the operator at TRW at this point in the plot.
		These messages are also plotted across the bottom
		of the film for identification purposes.
		The first line always identifies us, subsequent
		lines should identify the plane number (0 to 4,
		top to bottom) and what it is. End with a blank
		line.

If you specified "D" mode:

	TYPE X,Y OF HOLES TO ADD TO DRILL TAPE
	DECIMAL POINT OK, OFFSET WILL BE ADDED.

	Then loop asking the question:

	X,Y OF HOLE?

	Until you type just return.
	The hole are placed on the front of the drill tape
	in the order in which you typed them.

If this is not a drill plot (pads for drill holes only), the following
question is asked (unless this is a TRW run):

	SKIP PLOTTING OF ALL PADS?

	This is only useful on calcomp for overlaying plots with the same
	pads.

Now the program will spew out various things about how far along it is.
If the card number was available when the plot files were written, it
was passed in the file. If not, the following question will be asked:

DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 23-4

	CARD NUMBER?

		Here you type the number of the card you want to use.
		If you type 0<cr> or just <cr>, no card will be done.

Here progress on the card is indicated.
Now the program will type:

ACTUAL MAX X = 0.000  MIN X = 0.000  MAX Y = 0.000 MIN Y = 0.000

These numbers include the card outline as well as lines, text, etc.
They must be copied to the TRW planning sheet if this is a TRW plot.

Then it says:

PLOT DONE!

And here we loop back to the plot filename prompt!
Unless the "G" output mode was selected, in which case we go to the
'X' prog which runs automatically.
DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 24

MORE PC CARDS -- AFTER PCP

At completion of plots, the following command should be typed to
generate an FR80 tape:

COPY MTA0:FOO_STANFO.F80[DAT,RPH],<all your F80 files, specifying ppn>,STANFO.F80[DAT,RPH]<cr>

To punch paper tape from an XXX.DRL file, run TD[F,RPH] and type the filename
XXX, this is a separate program because the tape must be punched in binary.

To make a TRW magtape from your 'MAG' files, type:

COPY MTA0:/EVEN_XXC.MAG,XXS.MAG,XXP.MAG,XXG.MAG,XXD.MAG

Were the file names are the appropriate files you have just generated.

The order is not important, but should agree with the file numbers on the
planning sheets and any messages on the tape itself.

You should also XGP all the 'LOG' files and put the file #'s on them.

RUNNING WL

		How to run the wire lister

			   or

	Easy little steps for muddy little feet

    Commands are single letters with or without control or meta. The command
may be preceeded by any of the following:

	DEC		NODEC
	(NOTHING)	(nothing)
	ONE ALT		control
	TWO ALTS	Meta
	THREE ALTS	control-meta
ˆ	    doesn't matter

If more than one of the above appear, then all will satisfy command.
In all but the "I" command, if only one wire list exists, the "WIRE
LIST ID?" prompt will be skipped.

Commands:

ˆE	EXIT.


ˆ@	SAME AS "XDSKIN".


D	Enter DIP SUB-MODE. See next page for commands in DIP SUB-MODE.


_<wire list id>
	Set default wire list id. This is the wire list which is used
	for all commands requiring single wire lists. The 2 wire list
	id's are "D" and "PC".


_	Toggle wire list id's. (switch from D to PC or back).


I OR I
	ASKS:
	FILENAME?

	You may type a filename (default extension is ='WD' and ='WPC')
	or @filename (default extension is "DIR"). The format of
	a "DIR" file will be explained later.
	If you type "" you get wire list with id "D". If you type ""
	you get the wire list with id "PC".

	The file(s) are read, signal names are compared and the
	wire list is built.

	After the file name you may type a module location which takes
	effect for any dips or pins which do not already specify a
	module location. You may also type variable settings enclosed
DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 25-1

	in parentheses, separated by commas. See the end of this writeup
	for exact information. Example:
		IFOO 1AE3 (N0,M0) 1AE4 (N6,M1)
	This reads file FOO.WD twice, once (called slice 1) for
	module location 1AE3 with N=0 and M=0, and once for location
	1AE4 with N=6 and M=1.
	The file(s) are read, signal names are compared and the
	wire list is built.

I	Asks:

	FILENAME?

	Same options as reading 'WD' or 'WPC' files, default extension is 'WEQ'.
	This file contains some number of signal names on each line, seperated
	by tabs. The effect of this file is that each line is treated as a wire.
	So you may cause certain wires to be grounded or connected to HI, or even
	connected to other wires. Please note: The card location of the wire list
	you wish to affect should appear with the filename, just like reading a
	wire list.


U	Asks:

	CARD(NLLN)?	if necessary

	This copies the dips from the default wire list (a logic
	wire list), to the other wire list (a pc wire list). The
	locations are used for matching.


N OR N
	Asks:

	WIRE LIST TITLE?

	The string you type will be used on listings involving
	this wire list.

L	Asks:

	CARD (NLLN)?	if necessary

	This lists a wire list onto a file. The default
	extension is 'WL'.
	All sorts of neat things are indicated on
	the wire list, the best way to find out what
	they are is to make one.
	Any unnamed signals are given unique numbers
	which are printed preceeded by a "#".

L	Asks:

	CARD (LN)?	if necessary

	This makes the following summaries:

	Summarizes all dip types used in this wire list
DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 25-2

	totaling the different body names and total number
	of sections used.

	UNGENERATED SIGNALS

	UNUSED SIGNALS

	Each of these catagories is listed, only one
	of the names of a wire fitting the catagory 
	is listed. The default extension is 'WLS'.


L	Asks:

	CARD (NLLN)?	if necessary

	Then asks for a filename. The default extension is 'WLU'.
	Writes a listing file which is sorted by dip number. Under each
	dip number is listed the signals connected to each pin.
	At the end of the listing, the edge connector fingers are listed
	in alphabtical order along with the signal connected to each.

	This prints out the following info:

	LOC	DIPTYPE	BODY	POS	FILE

		For each body followed by:

		PIN #	TYPE	HI	LOW	USE	SIGNAL NAME

		For each pin of body.

	Then:

	CONNECTORS
	PIN	FILE	SIGNAL NAME

		For all connector pins.

	This allows you to find out a signal name from the LOC(PIN #).


P<signalname>
 or
P	which asks for signal name

	Then prints for that the signal name, the information which
	would be printed for that signal in L. Prints on TTY.


P	Asks:

	CARD (LN)?	if necessary

	Then asks:

	DIP OR CONNECTOR LOCATION?

DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 25-3

	Then prints info for that loc which you would have gotten in
	a L listing. Prints on TTY.


P	Asks:

	SIGNAL NAME?

	Then does P for this signal for each card currently read in.


	In addition, if <FORALL> (NODEC) OR ? (DEC) appears in front of the signal name both the
	hi and low versions of the signal will be printed. This works
	for P, P, and P.


W	Asks:

	CARD (LN)?	if necessary

	This writes a file for input to the PC prog for generating
	router files which are read by wagner's router prog.
	The default extension is "WDR".


W	This writes a back panel wirelist file from all the cards in
	the default wirelist. The default extension is 'BAC'.


B	Reads a back panel wire list written with W (default extension
	is 'BAC'). You may now make back panel listings using ˆX commands.


B	READS A 'BAC' FILE, BUT ONLY INPUTS FILENAME AND TITLE INFO,
	AND DIP COUNTS FOR MAKING AN 'MPL' FILE.


B	Reads a file of the same format as a 'WEQ' file, however default
	extension is 'BEQ'. It has the same effect on the back panel as
	a 'WEQ' file has on a card wire list. Except there is no problem
	with the card location, it applies to the whole back panel.


C	Asks:

	CARD (LN)?	if necessary

	Then asks for a filename. The default extension is 'WLC'.
	The card specified is found in D wire list and PC wire list.
	The two wire lists are compared and an error listing is
	produced. Make one to find out the format. The info from C
	is included in C.


C	Asks:

	CARD (LN)?	if necessary

DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 25-4

	This compares D and PC wire list as in C, but it only checks
	if you have placed the right dip sockets on the pc card for
	the dips you are using in the logic drawing. Also checks that
	you have not pre-assigned an illegal connector pin #. This
	be done only after a L verify has been done with no errors
	because the kinds of errors found by this check will confuse
	C.
DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 26


	EXTEND MODE COMMANDS
ˆX	If any control bits held down asks:

	Si?

	Now type a 1 to 6 (or more) letter command possibly preceded by
	a "-". The meanings of these commands are explained below:
	A "D" at the left means available in dip sub-mode only, a "B"
	means available in both top-mode and dip sub-mode, nothing means
	available only in top mode.

B	RESIDENT	Reads in the dip defintion file at the bottom of free
			core, and marks the last loc used.
			now whenever you type ^c start, the dips
			stay in the core image. All other data in program
			free storage is cleared.

B	-RESIDENT	Release dips from bottom of core. Now when
			you type ^c start the dips go away.

B	DDT		Enters DDT if loaded.

B	SAVE		Asks for a filename, (default extension is 'DMP')
			then executes a swap uuo to save the current core
			image. If DSKIN is in progress, it is suspended
			during the save and restarted (using DSKCON) after-
			wards. However, when the saved core image is run
			again, the DSKIN is not continued. It may be
			continued manually by a DSKCON command.
DEC			AT DEC NO SWAP UUO IS USED, THE PROGRAM MERELY
			EXITS TO THE MONITOR AND YOU MAY SAVE IT, THEN
			START OR RUN IT LATER.

B	DSKIN		Asks for a filename, (default extension is 'TXT')
			then takes input from there instead of tty. If an
			error is encountered, input reverts to the tty.

B	DSKHLD		Releases disk input file, remembering where it was.
			later you can give a DSKCON command to continue.

B	DSKCON		If the last dskin was held by a DSKHLD command or
			an error, the command causes the file to be reopened
			and the appropriate chars skipped to get it back where
			it was. DSKHLD and DSKCON are used by SAVE to get
			around the fact that the swap uuo does a reset.

B	DSKSKP		If no file open, asks for name and opens it.
			Reads to the next line feed echoing
			characters as it goes. Then asks "STOP?".
			If you respond with "y<cr>", then skipping stops and
			control reverts to who ever had it last.
			If you respond with altmode then
			skipping stops and control reverts to tty.
			Anything else causes then next line to be
			printed, skipped, and the prompt repeated.

	DEFPPN		Accepts a p,pn to use when none is specified (input only).
DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 26-1


	-DEFPPN		Resets defppn to 0. this is the default.
			the effect of 0 is that it is used for the p,pn
			on input unless you are reading filenames from
			and indirect file. in that case, the p,pn used are
			those of the indirect file.

B	CLEAR		This command is equivalent to "^C START<cr>" except
			that it doesn't flush DSKIN.

	STATUS		Prints out current program status, like SPACES, REFERENCES,
			PAGE, EXTENT, and default wire ID.

	SPACES		Makes spaces in signal names significant.
			Affects the I and I commands only.

	-SPACES		Spaces in signal names are no longer significant
			except when they seperate 2 digits.
			This is the default.

	REFERENCE	This enables the feature in 'WL' files which
			causes all signal names for a wire to appear
			in each alphabetical sorting of each name,
			but only one of them will have the pin
			information printed. All the others will print
			"_____ REFERENCE" next to the signal with which
			the pins appear.

	-REFERENCE	Disable references in 'WL' file. Signal names
			appear only once, with the pins.

	IERROR		Enable output of errors on wirelist file input
			to go to a file. When you do I, I, I, and B
			you are asked for a filename (default extension
			is 'WIE'). This file contains the filename of the
			file being processed and any errors which cannot
			be indicated later. If you respond with <cr> to
			the WIE filename prompt, output will go to TTY
			as if no IERROR command had been done.

	-IERROR		Disable input errors going to file, they will
			go to the TTY instead. This is the default.


	PART		Write a "PARTITION" file, default extension is
			'PAR'. This is the file for input to Wagner's
			partitioning program.

	SIGSUM		Write signal summary listing for entire wire list.
			Default extension is 'WSS'. These files may be
			merged by the program "M.DMP[WL,RPH]" to form a
			master signal summary ('MSS').

	ERRSUM		This writes a file (default extension is 'LES')
			which has each run of some of the categories from
			the wire list summary output. The difference is
			that this is a binary file which goes back into
			D and allows you to flash the runs from each
DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 26-2

			error category.

	CONSUM		Write connector pins needed summary. This lists
			signals in same format as SIGSUM but only those
			which need to get from one card to another, but
			don't. Default extension is 'WCS'.

	WLSSEL		LIKE L, EXCEPT THAT YOU ARE ASKED ABOUT EACH
			CATEGORY BEFORE IT IS WRITTEN INTO THE FILE.

	BSSEL		LIKE BSUM, EXCEPT ASKS ABOUT EACH CATEGORY.

	MAKALL		ASKS FOR ONE NAME AND POSSIBLE A CARD NAME, THEN
			DOES L, L, L (WRITES 3 FILES).

	BMAKALL		LIKE MAKALL, BUT DOES BLIST, AND BSUM.

	UMAKE		WRITES 'UML' FILE FOR INPUT TO "D" PROGRAM WHICH
			REPLACES ALL EDGE PINS WITH GENERATED "U" PINS.

	STUFF		WRITES 'STF' FILE WHICH TELLS FOR EACH DIP TYPE ON
			A BOARD WHERE IT IS USED (WHAT LOCATION).

	LPART		WRITES 'PRT' FILE WHICH TELLS FOR EACH DIP TYPE ON
			A BOARD WHAT ITS PART NUMBER IS AND HOW MANY ARE USED.

	UML		Prints a module map for the card you select. Also
			prints edge signals in boxes for each paddle.
			Default extension is 'UML'

	TEST	Asks:

			CARD (LN)?	if necessary

			This writes a card tester file for P. Petit's simulator.
			The default extension is "TST".

	ROUTE	Asks:

			CARD (LN) ?	if necessary

			This routes all runs on the specified card and then
			produces a listing (default extension 'WLR'). The
			listing is like a 'WL' listing except that the pins
			are ordered and a pseudo Z-level is indicated in an
			extra column.

	ZLEVEL	Asks:

			CARD (LN) ?	if necessary

			This routes all runs on the specified card and then
			produces a listing (default extension 'WLZ'). The
			listing is 4 from-to listings. First is PWR and GND
			Z-level 1 and Z-level 2. Then signals, Z-level 1
			and Z-level 2.

	BLIST		Write back panel wirelist, default extension is 'BL'.
DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 26-3


	BSUM		Write back panel wirelist summary, similar to 'WLS'
			for normal wirelist. Default extension is 'BS'.

	BPRINT		Asks for a signal name, and prints the run on the tty.
			DI<FORALL> (NODEC) OR ? (DEC) works here as in "P" commands.

	SIMPLE		Writes back panel information necessary for running the
			DEC wirelist package over the back panel.

	ASIMPLE		WRITES SAME INFO AS SIMPLE COMMAND, BUT ASSIGNS
			REAL PIN NAMES IN PLACE OF "U" PIN NAMES.

	REDAC	Writes a REDAC-compatible wirelist. First,
		the REDAC master library is read (filename LIBRY.RDC)
		automatically. If the library is not found, you are
		asked for the correct filename. Respond with <CR> if none
		exists. WL then asks:

		CARD (NLLN)?	if necessary

		Then asks for a filename. The default extension is 'CON'.
		If terminators are discovered in the wirelist, you will be
		asked whether or not you want them in the REDAC output.
		This writes a pc card interconnection list in the correct
		format for input to REDAC.


	STRAPS		Reads a 'C2C' file which has 2 card locations on each line
			seperated by a tab, specifying which cards have their back
			strap connectors strapped together. A special format allows
			each paddle to be mentioned explicitly so you can strap
			different paddles in different directions.
			An attempt is made to look at each wire which has a back
			connector on it. If it has no name, lose. Otherwise find
			the same named wire on the other card. If found then try
			to match edge pins on this wire with edge pins on that
			wire. A match occurs if they are the same pin, or if one
			or both are "wild" specified pins. This allows errors to
			be avoided when only one card is placed.

	CSTRAP		Asks for "CARD nlln" if necessary (should be). Then writes
			a file with the default extension 'DAT'. The file contains
			the back connector locations which are gotten by taking
			a wild back connector from this card and finding the
			matching connector on the other card. This allows pre-
			placement of pins which have been previously assigned
			on one of a pair of cards. The file is suitable for reading
			with the "IPINS" command in the drawing prog.

	EXTENT		This is the number of paddles to assume make it to the back
			panel for card with no location. It is initialized to 4.

	-EXTENT		This resets the extent to 4 (the default).

	PAGE		This allows you to set the number of lines per page to assume

	DIP SUB-MODE


ˆE		Exit to TOP MODE (commands on previous page).

ˆ@		SAME AS "XDSKIN".

ˆI<filename>	Input dip file into internal structure. If filename
		is omitted, last one used for I or W command is used.
		Name starts as "DIPS.DIP[<LIBRARY PPN>]". Default extension
		is always 'DIP'.

ˆW<filename>	Write internal list into file. Filename same as for I.

ˆN<filename>	Change (or just print if no filename arg) the default
		dip filename.

ˆL<cr>		Asks:

		FILENAME?

		Default extension is 'LSD'. This makes a listing of all
		dip definitions.

ˆD<dipname>	Delete definition of <dipname>. If <dipname> is blank
		you get DDT.

ˆP<dipname>	Print definition of <dipname> on TTY.

ˆR<dipname>	Rename dip with name <dipname>. Asks for new name.

ˆS<dipname>	SET PART NUMBER STRING FOR DIP <DIPNAME>.


ˆC<dipname>	Copy definition of <dipname>.
		Asks:

		NEW DIP NAME?

		If it already exists, you are asked:

		ALREADY EXISTS, REPLACE?

		Then you are asked:

		LOADING CONVERSION FACTOR?

		The format is <number> or <number>/<number>. This
		is the scale which is applied to all loadings of
		the old dip definition to get the new one.

ˆM<dipname>	Modify definition of <dipname>.
		If no definition exists for this dip name, it TYPES:

			NEW NAME	# OF PINS?

		Answer with <n><cr>.
DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 27-1

		If a definition already exists, types out the number
		of pins. Then a heading line is typed and echoing is
		turned off. It tabs to the PIN # column and waits for
		a command. Now you may type:

	<n><cr>		Types the information for pin <n>.
	<n><tab>	Types the information for pin <n> then tabs to
			the "TYPE" column. You can now change any or all
			of the data items for this pin. Type <cr> to
			fill in the rest of the line with the old stuff.
			Type <tab> to get to the next column. Bad format
			is filtered out and only good data is echoed. To
			leave a column unchanged, just <tab> to the next
			column without typing anything.
	<cr>		Asks for a new DIPNAME. You can either
			edit another dip or get back to DIP SUB-MODE by
			typing <cr>.
	A<cr>		Types pin <n+1> automatically when you type
			<cr> for pin <n>. You get out of automatic mode
			by typing <ALTMODE> or reaching last pin.
	T<cr> L<cr> U<cr> P<cr> S<cr>
			Automatically copies all columns to the left
			of the TYPE, LOAD, USE,  PS, and SECTION columns
			respectively when you type the <n><tab>
			command above.

		In all the above ALTMODE is equivalent to <cr>.
		Legal TYPES are:
		I  input			OP	 pull up output
		IS input with load sharing	VCC or P power
		O  output			GND or G ground
		OT tri-state output		NC or N  no connection
		OC open collector output
		You may prefix any of the above types with the letter
		"T" for TTL or "E" for ECL. YOU MAY FOLLOW AN I OR IS WITH
		"P" IF THIS PIN HAS AN INTERNAL PULLUP OR PULLDOWN.
		YOU MAY FOLLOW AN OUTPUT (O, OC, OT, OP) BY "F" IF
		IT IS A FLIP-FLOP OUTPUT. If the X commands ECL or TTL
		have been performed, the prefix "E" or "T" is assumed
		automatically. With no prefix, the pin definition is
		neutral with respect to TTL vs ECL.

		The USE column is for comments such as "S1" or "S4" on
		an ALU dip. PS is an arbitrary number which you assign
		to identify pins that share load. Give the same number
		to all pins that share with eachother. SECTION is for
		defining the sections of the dip and for specifying
		equivalent pins in other sections. The section information
		is: <logical pin #>/<section #>. The equivalent pins
		in different sections are identified by having equal
		logical pin numbers.

WL FILE FORMATS

In this part:

()	means optional
<>	syntactic entity
()*	0 or more of
<l>	single letter
<n>	1 or more digits
<cr>	Carriage return - linefeed


Argument to I or I TOP MODE commands:

<filename> ( .<ext> ) ( [<p>,<pn>] ) ( ( <slicespec> )* ) <cr>

"DIR" files:

( <filename> ( .<ext> ) ( [<p>,<pn>] ) ( ( <slicespec> )* ) <cr> )* <eof>


<slicespec>	::=	( ( <n> ) <l> ( <l> ) <n> ) ( "(" ( <n> <lessthan> )
			( <n> <greaterthan> ) <l> <n> ( , <l> <n> )* ")" )*

"(" and ")" stand for a parenthesis pair.

This is a list of files to read for "I" or "U" commands.

The first part of the slicespec allows you to specify the
		<bay><toprack><bottomrack><slot>
for any unspecified dip locations. In addition the filespec for the indirect
file may include a <n><l><l><n> construct which will be used on any filespec's
in the file which don't have their own. The rest is for the special construct in
signal names which we will call expressions. The <n><lessthan> sets the lower
bound of values to <n>, the <n><greaterthan> sets the upper bound.
The <l><n> sets variable <l> to <n>. The format of a signal name
which uses an expression is as follows:


<signal name>	::=	( ( <any char except "["> )* ( [ <expr> ] ) )* ( <cr> )*

<expr>		::=	<form1> | <form2> | <form3>

<form1>		::=	<form3> ( , <string> )*

<form2>		::=	( <form3> "{" <STRING> "}" )* ( <FORM3> )

<form3>		::=	<secondary> | <secondary> <op1> <form2>

<secondary>	::=	<primary> <op2> <primary> | <primary>

<primary>	::=	"(" <expr> ")" | - <primary> | + <primary> | A-Z | <number>

<op1>		::=	+ | -

<op2>		::=	/ | *

<number>	::=	0-9 | 0-9 <number>
DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 28-1


The "()" pair in the primary definition may be replaced by a "<>" pair,
but you must close with the same thing with which you opened.

If <expr>=<form1> the <form3> expression is evaluated. Then the thing
in [] is replaced by the I'th string (where value of <form3>=I). If
I less than or equal to zero, or I greater than the number of strings,
the thing in brackets is replaced with null.

If <expr>=<form2> the first <form2> expression is evaluated. If the value
is non-zero, the string contain in the following "{}" pair is the result
of the expr. Otherwise, the evaluation of the <form3> expression after
the "}" is done and so on until on becomes true or the "]" is reached.

If <expr>=<form3> the thing in [] is replaced by the decimal value
of the expression with leading zeroes added to make the length of the
result equal to the length of the longest variable <l> in the expression.

The following is the format of a "STRAP" file, it tells which
paddles of which cards are strapped together:

{<strap spec>}* <eof>


<strap spec>	::=	<card spec><tab><card spec><crlf>
		      |	<paddle spec><tab><paddle spec><crlf>

<card spec>	::=	{<bay>}<rack><slot>

<paddle spec>	::=	<card spec><paddle letter>

<bay>		::=	0-15

<rack>		::=	<top rack>{<bottom rack>}

<top rack>	::=	A-Z

<bottom rack>	::=	A-Z

<slot>		::=	1-63

<paddle letter>	::=	A-Z


SEMANTICS:

	The <card spec> construct is used if the back strap connectors
of both cards correspond on a one-to-one basis. The <paddle spec> is
used when different height cards are being described or strapping is
going to either side of a single card on different paddles.

HOW TO RUN REF

REF IS A PROGRAM TO GOBBLE DOWN 'WD' FILES
AND PRODUCE A LISTING, ORDERED BY SIGNAL NAME
SHOWING EACH FILE IT IS USED IN AND HOW MANY
TIMES IT IS USED.

THE PROG STARTS BY ASKING:

WD FILENAME?

TO WHICH YOU MAY TYPE EITHER

FILNAM.EXT[P,PN]	DEFAULT EXT IS 'WD'

	OR

@FILNAM.EXT[P,PN]	DEFAULT EXT IS 'DIR'

IF THE "@" CONSTRUCT IS USED, ANOTHER FILENAME IS SCANNED
FROM THE FILE, AND SO ON UNTIL END OF FILE (BLANK LINES ARE
IGNORED).

FILENAMES ARE GOBBLED AND THE FILES READ UNTIL YOU TYPE
A BLANK FILENAME FROM THE TTY.

IT THEN ASKS:

REF FILENAME?

YOU NOW MAY TYPE THE OUTPUT FILENAME (DEFAULT EXT IS 'REF').
IF BLANK NAME IS TYPED, OUTPUT GOES TO THE TTY.

MISCELANEOUS
DRAWING PITFALLS:

1.	LINES WHICH APPEAR TO TOUCH MAY NOT INTERSECT IN THE DATA
	STRUCTURE. TO INSURE CONTINUITY YOU MUST EITHER:
		A. USE THE "-" METHOD TO HAVE A LINE YOU ARE DRAWING
		   INTERSECT A POINT YOU CAN SEE.
		B. USE THE "A" OR "A" METHOD TO ATTACH TO A POINT OR
		   LINE RESP.

(IN CASE OF DIFFICULTY, LEARN THE "B" AND "B" FUNCTIONS.)

2.	LABELS (LOGICAL NAMES) MAY APPEAR NEAR A WIRE AND NOT BE
	ASSOCIATED WITH IT. TO FORCE ASSOCIATION, YOU MUST:
		A. GET ON THE POINT AT THE END OF THE WIRE AND PLACE THE
		   TEXT THERE. MOVE THE WIRE IF THE TEXT GETS GARBAGED BY
		   SOME NEARBY OBJECT.

3.	USE "XDANGLE" TO FIND MOST ERRORS OF FORM 1 AND 2.

(YOU MIGHT USE THE "A" FUNCTION TO ATTACH SOME TEXT TO THE NEAREST POINT)

PC CARD LAYOUT RESTRICTIONS (BY MCGUIRE):

	THE  FOLLOWING  LAYOUT  TECHINQUES  ARE  TO   BE   CONSIDERED
MANDITORY UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE:

	THE STANDARD STEP SIZE (50 MILS) WILL BE USED IN ALL PC CARDS
EXCEPT FOR SPECIAL PURPOSE ONES. THIS ALLOWS EXACTLY ONE WIRE TO PASS
DIRECTLY BETWEEN TWO PADS.

	WIRES  BETWEEN  PADS  SHOULD BE WITHIN 15 DEGREES OF STRAIGHT
THROUGH TO ALLOW 18 MILS  OF  CLEARANCE  BETWEEN  WIRE  AND  PAD,  30
DEGREES GIVES 15 MILS OF CLEARANCE, STRAIGHT THROUGH GIVES 20 MILS OF
CLEARANCE.

	WIRES BETWEEN PADS ARE ALLOWED ONLY ON THE TOP (DIP INSERTION)
SIDE OF PC CARDS OWING TO TROUBLE WITH SOLDER BRIDGING ON THE BOTTOM.

	SPACING BETWEEN WIRES MAY BE THE MINIMUM, THAT  IS  50  MILS.
CONSIDER PADS AND FEED THROUGH TO BE 52 MILS IN DIAMETER AND WIRES TO
BE 10 MILS WIDE (AFTER ETCHING).

	IF A FEED THROUGH IS TO BE PLACED BETWEEN TWO WIRES THE WIRES
MUST  BE  AT LEAST 100 MILS APART IN ORDER THAT THE 20 MILS CLEARANCE
BE MAINTAINED AROUND THE FEED THROUGH.

PLANE DESIGNATIONS:

IN ORDER TO AVOID CONFUSION THE FOLLOWING PLANE DESIGNATIONS
WILL BE USED IN ALL PC CARDS:

	PLANE	USE

	  0	GROUND PLANE.
	  1	FIRST POWER PLANE(USE THIS IF ONLY ONE)
	  2	SECOND POWER PLANE(USE THIS AND 1 IF TWO POWER PLANES)
	  3	THIRD POWER PLANE.
DSK:DRAW;SUDS 7						Page 33-1


IF SOMEBODY NEEDS MORE THAN 4 PLANES, HE IS CRAZY AND SHOULD SEE
RPH FOR TREATEMENT.

EXTERIOR PLANES!!!!!!!!

	THE SIDE OF THE BOARD INTO WHICH DIPS ARE  INSERTED  WILL  BE
REFERED TO AS THE TOP. THE OTHER SIDE WILL BE REFERED TO AS THE OTHER
SIDE.
