These are the sources for the draw program of the Stanford drawing system.
Questions to H, JLK.
SUDS maintenance is now being done on MC.  The appropriate directories are:
	DRAW;  -- drawing system files
	WL;    -- wirelister files
	PC;    -- PC program files
	DATDRW; -- Bin files, bodies librarys, DIP info, SUDS documentation, etc.

On AI, the directories DRAW, DRAW1, DRAW2, WL, NEWWL, NEWDRW, and DATRPH
have been flushed.  The canonical place for bin files for TS D, TS WL, etc.
is now DATDRW;  (this includes the SCNV program).

Info on dumping out a new D, PC or WL is recorded in MC:DRAW;D INFO,
MC:DRAW;PC INFO and MC:WL;WL INFO respectively.
