VERIFY X-COMMAND TO SEE IF PROP COMPILATIONS ARE CONSISTENT

CHECK FETCH-STORES
	1) STARTING LOOP WITH "LOCATIVE" -  ALL NXT TYPE
	  FETCHES ARE LEGAL IF THEY RESULT IN A PTR
	  THAT IS NULL, OR TO TYPE FETCHED.
	2) BODY DELETE CAN CHANGE PINS INTO POINTS!

SOME THINGS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DIPTYPE
WHICH MAY BE HUNG OFF OF BODIES, OR INHERITED FROM TYPES
	- # OF SECTIONS
	- # OF PINS DEFINED
	DIP DEF LIST GIVING
		- PIN NAME
		- SECTION(S)
		- SECTION PIN #
	- PACKAGE TYPE 
	- # OF PINS IN PACKAGE

SETTING "DIPTYPE" PROP SHOULD CLEAR ALL DEFINITIONS
	MAYBE LOOK TO SEE IF DIPTYPE IS IN CORE
GETDEF READS DIPS.DIP AND DEFINES INFO FOR TYPE, AND ALL BODIES WITH
 THE SAME DIPTYPE
SETTING "PACKAGE" SHOULD OVERIDE PACKAGE DEF FROM DIPS.DIP
  THATS WHAT TXBIT IS THERE FOR
