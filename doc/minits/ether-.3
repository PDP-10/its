Notes on making new ethernet proms for MINITS boxes.

This file is for making boot proms ONLY.

The creation of boot-proms using BOOTIL is independant of the creation
of new downloads in <DCP.MINITS.E>.  

If you are changing network addresses then you better also change the
file on the boot hosts that associates pdp-11 addresses with what to
download into them.  For the AI Lab these files are:

       OZ:PS:<SYSTEM>11LOAD.FILES
       REAGAN:>PDP-11>11LOAD.FILES
       ZERMATT:>PDP-11>11LOAD.FILES

If you are changing network addresses you also should edit the namespace
objects of the hosts involved.  You might also check to see if your actions
impact safe sites.

NEED 2 2716's (Intel) per machine.

(1) Frob MINITS sources as need be, see the file MINITS.TEXT.
    Typically you edit OZ:<DCP.MINITS.S>CONFIG.PALX

(2) On OZ:
    Connect to <DCP.MINITS.BOOT-PROM>
    PALX BOOTIL

    It needs Vector, CSR and Chaos Addresses for the Chaos/Ether card(s).
    You must already have assigned these when you edited CONFIG.PALX
    on OZ (Usually use default vec and csr).  Answer all the questions
    intelligently.

    This writes BOOTIL.BIN in <DCP.MINITS.BOOT-PROM>.  
    You may wish to rename it if you are doing multiple machines at once.
    It is only needed for step (3) below.


(3) On a Lisp Machine with a prom programmer attached and the prom-programmer
    facility enabled.

    (load "oz:ps:<dcp.minits.boot-prom>prom")
    (27burn)

    Answer intelligently and your proms get programmed.

    More info on prom programming is in SYS:FACILITIES;PROMP.DOC

;
;(2) ON MX
;    :PALX KTV;BOOTIL >
;
;    It needs Vector, CSR and Chaos Addresses for the Chaos/Ether card(s).
;    You must already have assigned these when you edited CONFIG.PALX
;    on OZ (Usually use default vec and csr).
;
;    BIN in HSNAME
;
;    Ram starts at 156000 (requires 1000)
;
;    N.B., If you are doing more than one host, you cannot do this
;          step n times because output always goes into BOOTIL BIN.
;
;(3) On MX
;    :LISP
;    (LOAD "DCP;PROM")
;    (27BURN-PALX-BIN-FILE <in> <out>)
;    e.g., <in> "DCP;BOOTIL BIN"
;    e.g., <out> ".TEMP.;NE437A"
;
;    Wants to start at 3000 (the default I think)
;
;    This creates two files, e.g. .TEMP.;NE437A B00
;			    and  .TEMP.;NE437A B08
