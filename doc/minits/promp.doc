Instructions for using the prom programmer with a 3600.

    The prom programmer is connected to the 3600 using a serial port.
It connects to the EIA Port 2 connector at the back of any 3600.  A null
modem and various sex change connectors are required and should already
be in place.  The recommended speed is 1200 baud which corresponds to
position 7 of the rotary pot hidden in a hole in the back of the prom
programmer.  Faster speeds, such as 9600 baud, may be attempted but
there is some specialization in the code to handle this and it has not
been debugged as of this writing.

    To use the programmer physically insert the appropriate pack
(carefully) and then turn it on.  After the self test has completed, you
need to place the programmer in remote mode.  Do this by pushing
<Select> <F> <1> <Start> <Start> .  You must hit "Start" twice.

The function call (PROGRAMMER-RESET) should be used to initialize the
programmer, but it is perhaps of greater value in that it reassures you
that the programmer is operating.  If (PROGRAMMER-RESET) returns T you
have an operational connection. If it hangs in "Serial In" you do not
have an operative connection.

    If you are using the UniPak the device type will probably default to
a 2716.  You can set the device type using the function call:
     (PROGRAMMER-SET-TYPE "Prom Type String") 
For various current prom types look at the table at the top of the code
file.

    To program a prom or a pal you need to have the data stored in a
lisp array in ascending order and to have this array be the value of a
symbol.  To program a prom call:
     (PROGRAMMER-PROGRAM-PROM 'Symbol-with-array-value)

    This will load data into the programmer without programming the
prom, then read it all out again and compare it.  If the data checks ok
the machine then prints something like:
     "Insert fresh prom and type Y when ready"

     Put your fresh prom in the programmer if you have not already done
so and type <y> or <space> to begin the actual burning operation.

    Once the prom has been burnt the programmer will automatically be
instructed to perform a Verify of the data now in the prom.  If it
verifies ok you will be notified of success, and if not of failure.

------------------------------------------------------

    There are some other ways to use the stuff that involve the
construction of "Prom Files" which can be quite useful.  These are
documented with the code and I will not restate them here as I'm just
trying to give you a basic feel for how it works.  You can look quickly
over the code if you wish more information.
