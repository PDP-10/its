SPACE-WAR

     This is Spacewar for the IMLAC PDS-1.

     Spacewar is controlled from the switches on the Programmer's
Console of a PDS-1.  The keyset and keyboard are also used to a limited
extent.  The meanings of the console switches are as follows:


       SHIP 1          CONTROL          SHIP 3          SHIP 2
    (stubby ship)                  (triangle ship)   (needle ship)
  |               |               |               |                |
  | 0   1   2   3 | 4   5   6   7 | 8   9  10  11 | 12  13  14  15 |
  |               |               |               |                |
    <- ->   a   f   s   g   3   r   <- ->   a   f   <-  ->   a   f  
                    p   r   r   a
                    i   a   d   n
                    n   v       d
			i   s   o
			t   h   m
			y   i
			    p


     For each ship, the left button is counter-clockwise roll, the
second is clockwise roll, the third is rocket thrust, and the right-
most is bullet firing.
     Putting both rolls on at once causes warping.
     Putting thrust and both rolls on at the same time makes you
invisible or visible, depending on your current state.

     Control switches:

Switch 4 - In down position, turns on spin mode, in which angular
	   momentum is conserved.  In non-spin mode, the ship will not
	   rotate if neither rotation switch is down.

Switch 5 - In down position, turns off the Sun's gravity.

Switch 6 - In down position, adds 3rd ship (triangle ship) at start of
	   game.  If this ship is in the game, it uses the keyset (to
	   eliminate the tangle of fingers on the console switches.

Switch 7 - In down position, randomizes starting positions.

     The rightmost four keys on the keyset will also control ship 1 or
ship 3 (depending upon whether there are 2 or 3 ships in the game)in a
manner similar to the four switches.

     Typing "BREAK" causes the game to be interrupted into a mode where
the scores are displayed and keyboard commands may be typed.  Commands
currently available are:

	R - reset scores to zero.

     Spacewar loads into the high 4K of the IMLAC and thus may be
loaded on top of SSV without destroying it.  To return to SSV, type
control-Z on the keyboard.
