I do see all the various dependencies that DEFSTRUCT has (sharpsign, defmacro, other_other, defstruct). I'm confused by defstruct's having a dependency on defstruct (circular), but this may be due to the fact that defstruct's current implementation uses defstruct, and you have to bootstrap from a previous version of defstruct (thus, we'd need STRUCT FASL in order to build STRUCT FASL).  I'm checking with Alan Bawden on this."

    "body": "While I *think* I'm able to build a STRUCT FASL from NSTRUC 280, the size of the resulting FASL is a little different from that in the PI distribution (8 +959 versus 8 +993).  I realized that earlier on, I had created an empty ALAN; STRUCT BOOT file (because compiling NSTRUC 280 requires this file, but I can find no such file in any of our virtual tapes).  Creating the empty file allows the compilation to succeed, and, as I said, the resulting FASL loads into lisp, and seems to provide DEFSTRUCT functionality, but since I don't know what was in STRUCT BOOT and since the sizes are slightly different, it is conceivable that we haven't reconstructed the identical FASL file."

    "body": "Ahhh, it appears that ALAN; STRUCT BOOT is supposed to be a link to ALAN; NSTRUC FASL.\r\nReplacing my empty STRUCT BOOT with NSTRUC FASL doesn't make the sizes match either.  Now, the compiled NSTRUC FASL is 8 +962, whereas the version in LISP; STRUCT FASL (which is a link to LIBLSP; STRUCT FASL) is 8 +993.  So a little closer, but not exactly.  I suspect, however, that this is all fine.  When ALAN (or whoever) last built STRUCT (NSTRUC), I suspect the PREVIOUS version of STRUCT FASL was different (earlier/older).  This might account for the differences."

It was inspired by a program from NASA Ames Research Center where you (by yourself) wandered around in a 3-d maze.\r\n> \r\n> The program ran with up to eight users on IMLAC PDS-1 computers (a PDP-9 sort of frob with a parasitic display processor) and a server on the MIT-DM machine for each user.  The servers watched a shared page in the ITS memory and dumped moves into it.\r\n> \r\n> Maze (as we called it) was an instant hit.  Without Maze there would have been no Zork and no Infocom, because aside from myself, all the authors of Zork were attracted to DM by Maze.  In the evenings, most of the Imlacs would be taken up by mazers.  The best (who I see on your CC: list) was Ken Harrenstein, who was no fun to play with because you could never beat him.  He was much faster than the program, in fact, and I think he's the one who finally improved the transmission algorithm to merely send changes in state rather than reproduce the whole state.\r\n> \r\n> There also were (unfriendly) robots, to make the game more interesting if there were only one or two player.  They were pretty stupid, although I did try to make them adjust their ability level based on how you were doing against them (if only Ken had done that...)"

I also found a note in the comments that credits Steve Colley of Cal Tech and Howard Palmer of Stanford with the original idea, including the single-player mouse-in-a-maze and \"crude multiple players\" (to Colley).\r\n> \r\n> Whether the Xerox version springs from Greg's and mine or independently from the Colley/Palmer version, I don't know.  I didn't know them (I'm not even sure Greg knew them).  I suspect the Xerox version springs from ours, because except for the eyeball (we used the player's login name and a superposed arrow or beady eyespots) and the continuous view of the whole maze above, the versions are nearly identical in appearance.\r\n> \r\n> Also, Charles Frankston (of Visicalc fame) worked with Ken Harrenstein on the fast transfer protocol, according to another note in the source."

    "body": "Ken Harrenstien:\r\n> OK, I looked at the listings.  Here are the credits shown:\r\n>\r\n> WRITTEN BY:\r\n> - STEVE COLLEY    CAL TECH        ORIGINAL IDEA OF MAZE, STAND-ALONE MAZE & CRUDE MULTIPLE PLAYERS\r\n> - GREG THOMPSON   M.I.T.          FULL MULTIPLE PLAYERS ADDITIONS\r\n> - P. D. LEBLING   M.I.T.          PDP-10 MESSAGE SWITCHER AND ROBOTS\r\n> - HOWARD PALMER   STANFORD        ORIGINAL IDEA & STAND-ALONE VERSION OF MAZE\r\n>\r\n> In addition, I and CBF (Charles Frankston) at MIT made a number of additions and fixes to the Imlac code, PDP-10 code, and maze protocol. I never met either Colley or Palmer and never saw any code that I could positively attribute to them, although if there was any it would be in the Imlac half.  As far as I knew, Greg (GAT) did the bulk of the Imlac code, and Dave (PDL) did the initial PDP-10 communications half.  For a real Origins story, those people should obviously be contacted.\r\n> \r\n> MAZE was developed and played in an extremely unique environment.  The Dynamic Modelling group at Project MAC had a PDP-10 which ran ITS (as did the other PDP-10s on the 9th floor -- AI, ML, and later MC). Unlike the other systems, however, they used Imlac PDS-1 graphics workstations as terminals -- these were very expensive \"terminals\" however, and for their time were quite powerful.  Not any Imlac would do; these had to be 8K graphics Imlacs with long vector hardware and a special wiring modification (done on-site by hardware hackers) known as the \"8K display addressing mod\".\r\n> \r\n> In order to play MAZE, a hacker had to find a free unused Imlac, and log on to MIT-DMS and then invoke a PDP-10 program (called MAZE, of course, but later on renamed to less obvious names) which then down-loaded the Imlac program into the user's machine.  Each player thus had a job logged into ITS which shared a core page with each other MAZE job (the details of how this was achieved are interesting but probably irrelevant) and used this for instantaneous updates of game status.  Communication with each Imlacs was over a serial I/O line (at 19.2 or 9.6Kbaud, I forget which), thus the maze protocol made use of compact character sequences to transmit updates bidirectionally.\r\n> \r\n> A third program existed which was created somewhat late in the history of MAZE.  This was a \"watcher\", written in MUDDLE (whereas the PDP-10 and Imlac halves were both written in assembler), which drove an Evans and Sutherland graphics display (talk about overkill!) and served to provide interested onlookers and kibitzers with an overhead view of the entire MAZE game, including all the players.  It did not participate in the game; it merely observed the shared data page.  I forget who the author was but could probably remember or find out.\r\n> \r\n> Despite built-in usage restrictions and the like, a fourth program eventually appeared -- the \"Maze Guncher\" -- which was run as a batch job at various times and whose sole purpose was to detect MAZE games and corrupt the data page so that players would give up in disgust. This counter-hack was only successful against the unwashed majority of randoms who had heard about this neat hack and had somehow found a friend with a key that opened DMCG's 2nd floor door; it was programmed to pass over those of the inner circle, who in any case knew of its existence and knew the spells to sweep it away.\r\n> \r\n> MAZE playing eventually trickled off partly due to persecution of this sort (anything becomes boring with time, and when only a few people are allowed access, there aren't any replacements when the boredom sets in), but also largely because the Imlacs kept breaking down and it became difficult to find enough of them to mount a decent contest.  Two players is just practice; three becomes interesting; and four or more is ideal. Anyway, eventually all of the Imlacs, as well as the E&S, died off; and\r\nMIT-DMS itself passed away.\r\n> \r\n> Henry is probably right that during its heyday I was the most dangerous MAZE player.  I adopted the nom de guerre of \"Coeurl\" from A.E. Van Vogt's \"Voyage of the Space Beagle\" -- what better, in a glowing maze of rats, than to be a phosphorus-eating cat?  CBF was the only other serious threat.  One of our favorite tricks was to espy a maze game in progress on MIT-DMS late at night while working, and sneak down to the 2nd floor and quietly slip behind an unoccupied Imlac (the more isolated the better -- some were in hidden offices) and suddenly burst into the game-in-progress, running up incredible kill ratios as the novice rats scattered in panic and blundered into the walls.\r\n> \r\n> I just remembered another interesting sidelight.  We did some experiments with cross-network playing; Harry Chesley (HRC) while at Purdue had a couple of Imlacs that, once modified, could run the Imlac\r\nhalf of MAZE.  By logging into MIT-DMS they could then join a MAZE game while at Purdue.  However, this generally didn't work out too well since the network delays tended to cause problems; timing was\r\nextremely crucial (shots had a 2 second timeout) and the better the players were, the less acceptable became the bursty nature of the \"action\".\r\n> \r\n> The version of MAZE at Xerox PARC was, as far as I know, directly derived from experience at MIT-DMS; the few times I tried it, it was not as interesting because it seemed much slower.  Imlacs were vector graphic displays and the keyboard was read as a large bank of switches, which allowed near-instantaneous display switching and a user interface which let you keep keys pressed down for continuous movement.  By contrast, the Xerox Alto version had to update a raster display and keys had to be pressed one at a time... the speed difference was quite disappointing and the adrenaline just wasn't there.  There were probably also some problems introduced by fully distributing it over a network connection rather than having a central authoritative location for game status.  However, I don't have enough experience with it to comment further.\r\n"

Disk storage is\n         backed up frequently on magnetic tape, but magnetic-tape storage is\n         not generally available.  For registration as a user, either send a\n         message to ACCOUNTS@MIT-DMS, giving relevant information and\n         justification, or establish a TELNET connection, attempt to log in,\n         and a program will ask for relevant information.\n\n         Anyone who intends to use MIT-DMS more than once should enter\n\n         name and whereabouts in the data base of users by running the\n\n         INQUIR program.\n\n         MIT-DMS does not sell computer time.\n\n      (SERVICE-SCHEDULE)\n\n         MIT-DMS services are available to the network all the time,\n         except during preventive maintenance, alternate Tuesdays\n         07:00-11:00 Eastern time.

The most useful devices for FTP\n         are DSK (disk), ARC (\"archive\" file on disk), and MT0\n         (magnetic tape).  The directory provides a one-level\n         subdivision of DSK and ARC.  The first and second names are arbitrary\n         identifiers; the special name > results in access to the\n         highest-numbered name.\n\n         Syntactically, the device part is commonly designated\n         by a colon suffix, the directory by a semicolon, and\n         the first name by a space.  (The operating system has\n         no user interface for file names, hence these syntax\n         conventions are not rigid.)  Each part consists of up\n         to six printing-ASCII characters.  Case for characters\n         is not significant.\n\n      (PROTOCOLS)\n\n         (SERVER)\n\n            NAME       PROTOCOL TYPE  SOCKET         DOCUMENTATION\n\n            TELNET, Old  standard       1              NIC 15372\n            TELNET, New  standard       1, 23 decimal  NIC 18639 etc.\n            FTP          standard       3              NIC 17759/RFC 542\n\n            HOSTAT       private       15 decimal      NIC 17048/RFC 523\n\n            Time         standard      37 decimal      NIC 42218/RFC 738\n\n            NAME         standard      79 decimal      NIC 42758/RFC 742\n\n            SUPDUP       private       95 decimal      NIC 41953/RFC 734\n\n\n         (USER)\n\n            TELNET (new), FTP, HOSTAT, NAME, and SUPDUP protocols are\n            supported by the user-programs of the same name.

The functions of such a system include:\n\n          . Controlling radio transceivers in order to capture a signal\n\n            in the face of interference, fading, planned frequency\n            changes, etc.\n          . Separating a Morse-code signal of interest from competing\n            signals by \"tuning\" the reception to the ideosyncrasies of\n\n            the operator and the signal.\n          . Transcribing the hand-sent Morse code into a character\n            stream\n          . Correcting sender's errors in English text through low-level\n\n            understanding via a sentence parser and English dictionary\n\n          . Recognizing, understanding, and acting on Morse-code network\n\n            protocol and abbreviations\n          . Generating and transmitting appropriate short Morse-code\n            responses.\n\n      (REFERENCES)\n\n         Nearly all documentation is generated online locally.
