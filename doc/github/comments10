    "body": "Ok. The KA10 sim supports readin mode on the TMA/TMB tape interface. On TOPS10 I use BOOTM.REL as the boot block. RIM mode would probably also work since that is basically what readin mode is. The first word has a address/word count and data is placed there. \r\n\r\nI believe booting via Paper tape is also supported, however I have not tried it. \r\n\r\nKA10 sim supports readin of rim10,  .SAV, and .EXE files. It is basically the same code as Bob's KS10 for simH. "

If I have time tonight I will try and fix the bug I introduced last night adding TLB and starting to add ITS pager support. Otherwise it will probably have to wait until the weekend. Biggest problem I can see is getting all the patches to support the 1 proceed and other ITS specific changes to the KA. The paging is not much different then than the KI paging."

    "body": "I mean the low level formatting; writing the timing and marking tracks. I talked to Greenblatt and he said they didn't have anything of that sort...maybe programs supplied by DEC, but I'm not too familiar with DEC software. One other thing that I find strange is that both @rcornwell and Greenblatt said DECtape formats for different architectures were rather compatible. I can't imagine how that would work as the 36 bit format has an additional mark code (25, Block Space) that the 18 bit and 12 bit formats (which are otherwise identical) don't. And this code is quite important for reading too...not only used to extend the block number to 36 bits but also used to shift a register to time some actions."

    "body": "The Chaos variants should be better documented. My Chaos-over-UDP introduces a new protocol which essentially just wraps a Chaos packet in a UDP header, and sends it using configured mappings between Chaos and IP addresses. We had a network with, I think, four ITS hosts at one point (mine, Craig Lennox, and possibly Paul Svensson?). Brads Chaos-over-unix-sockets is for communicating between the CADR emulator and unix \"servers\" such as FILE, TIME etc, but only point-to-point I think. There is also Chaos-over-Ethernet which is a standard, used e.g. by more modern Lisp machines (original Chaosnet was 2 Mb/s). I once set up a bridge program between the three, so ITS could communicate with both the CADR emulator and a real Symbolics machine. Great fun!\r\n\r\nFor ITS, I would propose my Chaos-over-UDP using CH11. CH11 could of course be extended to use the other variants above, but with more work. See http://its.victor.se/wiki/ch11 for more info about CH11.\r\n\r\nUP is running CH11, so if you have a machine you want to join, let me know!"
