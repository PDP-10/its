    "body": "Yes, Charles got the IMP interface working — unfortunately, there is no Multics software stack source code available for code that uses the IMP.  Actually, that is not completely true — there is some — just not a complete stack.  I worked on getting the higher level software that uses NCP/IMP compiled and integrated but found too much of the underpinings that talked to the IMP (ABSI interface) missing. We abandoned the approach because we know of the existence (no source located yet) for the TCP/IP implementation that was user-ring (rather than ring-0).  There are tapes available (we think) but no one has dared try to read them for fear of destroying them.   Olin Sibert is the keeper of said tapes and we think the TCP/IP software may be on them.  \n\nHoneywell had the TCP/IP software as a “separately priced product”.

    "body": "From Hacker's Dictionary:\r\n\r\n**OS and JEDGAR**\r\n\r\nThis story says a lot about the ITS ethos.\r\n\r\nOn the ITS system there was a program that allowed you to see what was being printed on someone else's terminal. It spied on the other guy's output by examining the insides of the monitor system. The output spy program was called OS. Throughout the rest of the computer science world (and at IBM too) OS means operating system’, but among old-time ITS hackers it almost always meant ‘output spy’.\r\n\r\nOS could work because ITS purposely had very little in the way of ‘protection’ that prevented one user from trespassing on another's areas. Fair is fair, however. There was another program that would automatically notify you if anyone started to spy on your output. It worked in exactly the same way, by looking at the insides of the operating system to see if anyone else was looking at the insides that had to do with your output. This ‘counterspy’ program was called JEDGAR (a six-letterism pronounced as two syllables: /jed´gr/), in honor of the former head of the FBI.\r\n\r\nBut there's more. JEDGAR would ask the user for ‘license to kill’. If the user said yes, then JEDGAR would actually gun the job of the luser who was spying. Unfortunately, people found that this made life too violent, especially when tourists learned about it. One of the systems hackers solved the problem by replacing JEDGAR with another program that only pretended to do its job. It took a long time to do this, because every copy of JEDGAR had to be patched. To this day no one knows how many people never figured out that JEDGAR had been defanged."

However, Multics did support both 7-track and 9-track tapes.  From the manual “Multics Programmers Reference Manual”, AG91-04, Appendix F:\n\nAPPENDIX F\nMULTICS STANDARD MAGNETIC TAPE FORMAT\nThis appendix describes the standard physical format used on 7-track and 9-track\nmagnetic tapes on Multics. Tapes of this form may be written and read by the\ntape_mult_ I/O module (described in the Subroutines manual). Any magnetic tape not\nwritten in the standard format described here is not a Multics standard tape.\nSTANDARD TAPE FORMAT\nThe first recorded block on the tape following the beginning of tape (BOT)\nmark is the tape label record. Following the tape label record is an end of file\n(EOF) mark. Subsequent reels of a multireel sequence also have a tape label followed\nby an EOF mark. (An EOF mark is the standard sequence of bits on a tape that is\nrecognized as an EOF by the hardware.)\nFollowing the tape label and its associated EOF are the data records. An EOF is\nwritten after every 128 data records with the objective of increasing the reliability and\nefficiency of reading and positioning within a logical tape. Records that are repeated\nbecause of transmission. parity. or other data alerts are not included in the count of\n128 records. The first record following the EOF has a physical record count of 0\nmod 128 .\n. A.n end of reel (EOR) sequence is written at the end of recorded data. An EOR\nsequence is:\nEOF mark\nEOR record\nEOF mark\nEOF mark\n\nIt goes on from there.
