However, he answered that he didn't know much about dumping, and referred me to @cstacy.\r\n\r\n> I have ran into a problem involving TECO, which I have a hard time getting past.  Since you seem to have been one of the primary TECO hackers at MIT, I wonder if you could point me in the right direction?\r\n>\r\n> The problem is dumping a new standalone INFO.\r\n>\r\n> In ITS, there is a file INFO; INFO EMACS which would seem to do this.  INFO$^S :EMACS runs that file and dumps a new EMACS; TSINFO >.\r\n>\r\n> However, that dumped INFO doesn't work fully.  I starts EMACS, but doesn't enter INFO mode automatically.  The problem seems to be that the INFO EMACS installs a macro calling M(M.M Info Enter$) in FS ^R ENTER, but that macro isn't run in the new INFO.\r\n>\r\n> When I examine the value in FS ^R ENTER in the dumped INFO, it still has the default value, not the macro from INFO EMACS.  So it seems dumping the new INFO doesn't save FS ^R ENTER, or running INFO doesn't pick up the new FS ^R ENTER.\r\n\r\nIf Chris or someone else sees this, here is INFO; INFO EMACS:  \r\nhttps://github.com/PDP-10/its/blob/lars/info/src/info/info.emacs  \r\n(on a branch until this is solved)"

    "body": "Status update:\r\nI have found my two tapes from March 1984, with MUD and BCPL on them.  Holding them in my hand\r\nat this very moment.\r\nI SHOULD have them as .tap files, but there are many places to look.\r\nHowever, I have the (hopefully) full contents on disk on my tops-10 system(s).\r\nFiles READ.ME and READ.MUD from the MUD directory:\r\n\r\nTommy,\r\nThis is MUD! The file READ.MUD is a short note from Richard Bartle.\r\nThe .MAS files are the source, in compressed format - use the SUBFIL\r\nprogram to unpick them. However, it is all written in Essex BCPL, which\r\nwe sell under licence, so if you don't have it, let me know + I'll\r\narrange for licence forms to be sent to you. It isn't expensive - I\r\nthink 50 pounds for academic institutions - but we try to avoid\r\npiracy if possible.\r\nEnjoy your game!\r\nRick.\r\n\r\nFrom Bartle R[2011,2776] on February 14, 1984 at 6:59 PM\r\n        The source files for MUD (ie BCPL files) in SUBFIL format are\r\nas follows:\r\n        MUD.MAS[2011,2776]\r\n        MUD.TXT[2011,2776]\r\n        MUDTXT.MAS[2011,2776]\r\nall on DSKB of course! They won't be much use, however, the .EXE file and\r\nassociated bits are\r\n        MUD.EXE[2011,2011]\r\n        *.DBA[2011,2011]\r\n        MUD.??M[2011,2011]\r\n        DBASE.EXE[2011,2653]\r\nalso on DSKB. If DBASE is used, then then MUD.TXT and MUDTXT.MAS are useful,\r\ntoo.\r\n        There's another, smaller version of MUD called VALLEY. This consists\r\nof:     VALLEY.EXE[2011,2011]\r\n        VALLEY.??M[2011,2011]\r\nand some of the files that MUD needs.\r\n        If sending files is a costly business, then the minimumneeded to\r\nplay MUD is MUD.EXE, *.DBA and MUD.??M . If you want a smaller game, get\r\nVALLEY.* . If you want to correct minor bugs and do your own dungeons, get\r\nDBASE.EXE and MUD.TXT .

    "body": "I don't recall that the DM PDP-6 was ever powered on during my tenure (starting in 1974), but it was there--as suggested above, just to the right of the KA's console. I can't be certain of this, but there is a distinct impression (someone must have said something) that the PDP-6 was serial number omega. Of course, there was a similar impression that AI's was serial number alpha, and I see from the list that it's 2.\r\nI should know the serial number for XX, because God knows I called field service for it often enough, but alas...\r\nDM had a lot of dead / sketchy hardware lying about: apart from the 6, there was some Fabritek memory that never really worked (probably started out on the 6). Main memory included an MD10, a couple of MA10s, ultimately an MF10, and an ARM-10 (256K in one box!). And there was the Evans & Sutherland LDS-1, which worked occasionally--whenever Ed Black went up and fixed some more cold solder joints that had failed."

Was the Knight TV's resolution 576x454?  LMDOC;TVDOC might be of interest then.\r\n\r\n> \tThe initial TV display system is presently hooked to the machine and\r\n> works (although it currently must be driven from the PDP-11 console computer due \r\n> to the lack of the above memory interface).  This TV system is completely identical\r\n> to the Knight TV's on the AI PDP-10 in its major performance parameters.\r\n> Sometime in the first half of 1977 we hope to construct an improved TV display\r\n> system (offering 1000 line TV resolution among many other features).  This\r\n> improved TV display system would employ the same video buffer memory boards\r\n> as does the current one.  These boards mount 16 pin 4K RAMs, and are directly adaptable\r\n> to the new 16K RAMs which are just becomming available.  However,\r\n> the improved TV system is only a moderately high priority project since we can get \r\n> along quite nicely with the current TV system for the time being."
