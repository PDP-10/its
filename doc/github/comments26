    "body": "@atsampson, you asked about MIDAS from DM ITS.  I have been prodding the Infocom people about PDP-10 software, but it seems they don't have any.\r\n\r\nWe do know there were backup tapes being made, but we don't know what happened to them.  The Dynamic Modeling organization was quite separate from the AI Lab.  DM was closed down around 1980ish, wereas the AI Lab lived on.  This may explain why there is a lot more AI Lab material around than from DM.\r\n\r\nI don't want to wear down the patience of the MIT people.  Can you ask around?\r\n\r\nI have tried to locate Al Vezza, who was some kind of director or the Dynamic Modeling group, but so far I haven't found any way to contact him."

    "body": "Some random thoughts.  Please discuss further.\r\n\r\n- Where should the executabes go?\r\n\r\n   I put the original ADVENT in SYS3, because there was such a TS ADVENT in the AI and MC snapshots.  It's most likely the wrong ADVENT, though!  Feel free to put the right version there if you like.\r\n\r\n   I think the other executables should be in EJS or GAMES.  They can be plain files, or in an archive.  Since archives are so transparent in ITS, they are almost like subdirectories.  Since we have three ADVENT versions, one each could go in SYS3, EJS, and GAMES.  Bad idea maybe...\r\n\r\n- Where should the source code go?\r\n\r\n   I only created GAMES to have some place to put games that didn't exist in the snapshots.  Now that we have EJS and BTM1, maybe that's the proper location for all games.  This EJS person must have been a hard-core gamer!\r\n\r\n   I personally don't think the confusion would be too bad if the files were all in the same directory.  But having them in three separate archives is fine too.\r\n\r\n- Building from archives.\r\n\r\n   We don't need to extract the files, do we?  Just build from the archives.  I see some historical binaries were built that way, so we can do that too."

The majority of the code is identical.\r\n\r\n.LNKOT tells MIDAS to dump out all the STINK information that's been accumulated so far. It would otherwise do this at the end of compilation, so trying without it is on my to-do list, as is trying without the PURE/IMPURE stuff."

    "body": "I transcribed Bob's story as told in his Get Lamp interview:\r\n\r\n> The game was known as Dungeon at the time I met it.  And what happened was it drifed in from MIT, via the ARPAnet.  The MIT system that was being used as a development base was called ITS, which stood for the \"Incompatible Timesharing System\", which was a play on a much older MIT system called CTSS, the \"Compatible Time-Sharing System\".  And there was a way to run it on a more conventional PDP-10 operating system called TOPS-20 of which there were a few, but only a few, in DEC.  Most of them ran an older system called TOPS-10.\r\n> \r\n> And so it drifted in and as usual for a company - relatively small company in those day - the word began to get around that there was this much more elaborate, much more interesting and complicated puzzle/text adventure/problem solving game.  And it was extraordinary difficult to get access to it because, as I said, the machines that even DEC owned that could run it were relatively few and far between.  And having just come off working with Adventure, I was very eager to learn more about these games and when I saw Dungeon with its full-fledged parser and its far more elaborate descriptive mechanisms and just the general richness of the whole environment, it was very very interesting to me to see it.\r\n> \r\n> And it was also frustrating to play, because access was limited.  It was a hard game - much harder than Adventure.  And it was incomplete at the time.  It was still being elaborated by Marc and Tim and the rest of the MIT gang.  There was version skew going on between them and anybody else was playing it.\r\n> \r\n> So the same idea occurred to me which was if it was on a small machine, I'd have access to it.  A lot more people would have acess to it, and we'd know more about it.  So kind of without quite really understanding what was involved, I decided, well I'll do the same thing.  I'll port it.  There were only a couple of, sort of, minor assumptions that weren't quite right in my thinking.\r\n> \r\n> The first is of course that it wasn't written in Fortran.  It was written in an obscure variant of a functional language like Lisp that was called MDL, Model Development Language.  And when I first saw the sources I was like, what is this?  I'd just have no clue what I was looking at.\r\n> \r\n> Then the second thing is, it's a much bigger game.  The source size for Dungeon at the time was probably five to ten times the size of the Adventure sources.  So the notion of trying to shoe-horn this into the machine target I had, which was the smallest most personal PDP-11 of the time, was a bit more daunting.\r\n> \r\n> And then the third problem was it wasn't done.  It was changing all the time.\r\n> \r\n> So, well, I didn't know any better.  And nonetheless I decided I would do this.  I would do it in the only higher-level language that I was really fluent in which was Fortran.  C was certainly available but it was probably not a single Unix system in DEC at the time.  So Fortran was it.\r\n> \r\n> I bought a book on Muddle from the MIT Press.  And started in doing some probe coding.  And this was probably in late 1977 or early 1978.  And I would not have made a huge amount of progress, except that in early 1978 there occurred what is foundly called the Blizzard of 78, when 26 inches or so of snow fell on the place in early February.  And the state was shut down for a week.  I was home.  I was home with a printed Muddle listings.  And the book.  And I didn't have anything else to do at the time.  So during that week I fundamentally worked out how to represent the data structures and the algorithms in Fortran from the sources I had.  And I did a probe coded version of the game with no parser.  But nonetheless you could basically type in numerical equivalents for a command and then it would go off and it would do the game action.  It would display rooms and do actions and the pirate would show up and the thief would show up and cut your throat and all the good things it's supposed to do.\r\n> \r\n> When I had this running in March of 78 I made contact with the guys at MIT and said, hey you know, it's possible to run this on a much smaller machine.  Would you be interested in supporting this by actually giving me the complete source set as opposed to the fragment that I had.  They came out to where I was working, and I was actually working right across the divide here in the other building.  And they were completely astounded to see that what they regarded as a mainframe large scale program was running on this - from their point of view - tiny machine.  They agreed to provide the full source set so that I could port as much of the game as existed at the time.  So for really the first half of 78, I finished off an initial complete implementation and put that out in DECUS.  Their one condition was that the big database file, the text file, that sort of had all the strings couldn't be published in unencrypted form.\r\n> \r\n> And then basically as new inputs came in - they finished the endgame and so forth - I kept up with what they were doing for about the next eighteen months.\r\n"

    "body": "I've now got most of the 1973 MUDDLE source to assemble with current MIDAS and load successfully into current STINK (provided you fix the \"bad format\" problem mentioned above): https://github.com/PDP-10/muddle/tree/ats/its73\r\n\r\nBut the NUPRM source turns into binary junk halfway through, so I haven't been able to assemble it, and the symbols it provides (at least) are missing at the end of the link process. This is the equivalent of PRIMIT in the <mdl.int> source, so it's not really something we can do without; it'd need to be reconstructed from some combination of the newer PRIMIT and the TS MUDDLE binary.\r\n\r\nBy instrumenting STINK further, I've found two different causes of the nonsense pointer problem above:\r\n\r\n- With the 1973 source, I was initially using MIDAS 73. For most files, it was producing reasonable input to STINK, but for EVAL, MIDAS was producing link requests without the bit set that indicates that the address of the location to be updated should be relocated. Hence the bad pointer. MIDAS sets that bit (in LNKPRO) if it thinks the location of the symbol has been relocated; it was apparently getting confused by the junk after the END directive in that file, and removing it fixed it!\r\n\r\n- With the <mdl.int> source, and current MIDAS, MIDAS emits reasonable-looking link requests, but STINK sometimes relocates the address in them incorrectly. There's a good example of this when MUDDLE first uses its DOTCAL macro: it defines a symbol as . with some data after it, and MIDAS emits a link request for that symbol with the right address in, but the relocated location that STINK saves in its symbol table (from THRDR's call to RELOCT) isn't where it actually put the following data."

    "body": "MIDAS 289 does indeed have dynamic symbol table support; that was added in MIDAS 98 according to MIDAS ARCHIV. It can compile all of the <mdl.int> source with our fixes, and the resulting REL files get further in STINK than anything else I've tried so far. :-) It eventually fails in INITM when the .LOP .VALUE assertion in there fires, indicating the TVBASE table has overflowed. I've tried increasing TVLNT unsuccessfully but not looked into it any further yet.\r\n\r\nMIDAS ARCHIV also says that in MIDAS 135, as part of adding .DECTWO support, \"IT IS O.K. TO INTERSPERSE HIGH AND LOW SEGMENT CODE BY SAVING AND RESTORING THE TWO LOCATION COUNTERS\". So perhaps it worked originally, then broke at some point, then was fixed when adding .DECTWO, then broke again later...\r\n\r\nHowever, I've also had a look back at the original <mdl.int> files. There's a midas.exe in there in [TOPS-20 sharable save format](http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/dec/pdp10/TOPS20/V7/JSYS_REFERENCE.MEM.txt) - converting it with wfconv -au produces output that doesn't look quite right but does include the ASCIZ string \"CORRECTION PLEASE.\", which appears in the MIDAS 73 binary but not in 76 or later. So along with all the other evidence (BIN filenames in the STINK file, broken conditional blocks, STINK 1 not handling bad EXPUNG directives, no .SYMTAB directives in the source...) I'm pretty confident that <mdl.int> was being built with something close to MIDAS 73 rather than a later version."

[Using .LOP](https://github.com/atsampson/its-tests/blob/master/stink/dvalue.mid), I've had a look at the values it's testing, and they seem sensible, so I've fixed the assertion. (It's a linker-evaluated expression, so perhaps it never actually got evaluated correctly before, but I'm just guessing...)\r\n\r\nAll the MIDAS 323-compiled files now load into STINK 2. Useful commands at this point: `?` shows unresolved symbols, `-1?`shows unresolved symbols and the relocation chain for each, `S` shows resolved symbols.\r\n\r\nMost of the unresolved symbols were further ITS/TENEX conditional problems. I've pushed fixes for these to [ats/its](https://github.com/PDP-10/muddle/tree/ats/its).\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm now left with a set of unresolved symbols with names like \"TO B$F\" and \"J$XGA7\". Dropping some extra symbols into the source and looking at the output of -1?/S reveals that the locations STINK wants to write their values into are \"between files\" - i.e. adding a symbol at the end of MUDDLE's END macro and another at the beginning of the next file brackets the mystery addresses. So this looks like MIDAS doing something odd with REL output again, and the next step is to have a more careful look at the REL files.\r\n\r\n(I tried this with MIDAS 289 as well; same behaviour.)"

The true source, if it ever existed, has been lost in the distant fires of ITS dump tapes being burned at the stake.\r\n>\r\n> I was thinking about a possible hack which at some point might require the services of STINK.  Never mind what it is.  The problem as I saw it was not the fact that STINK is unique and unsupported, but the fact that STINK could not be supported without a real source.  So I made a half-hearted attempt to investigate by comparing the (faulty) result of an assembly with the existing binary, using SRCCOM's /$ switch.\r\n> \r\n> Boy, am I glad I put that hack into SRCCOM.  The comparison much to my surprise showed the binaries were virtually identical, except for one changed label and a couple of missing symbols.  It only took a few minutes to fix those and come up with a source that assembles into exactly the same thing (modulo .FNAM2) as the old TS STINK!\r\n> \r\n> Anyway, I wrote out this new source as STINK 200, and installed a new TS STINK.

    "body": "Second MIDAS bug found: it was writing out the symbol at the start of a CONSTANTS block in the wrong form. Here's [the fix to MIDAS](https://github.com/PDP-10/muddle/commit/8bfd9169aa0e4ec24cc41684c46b5f7efe1eb200) and [a testcase](https://github.com/atsampson/its-tests/blob/master/midas/const.mid).\r\n\r\nWith the versions of MIDAS and STINK in [ats/its](https://github.com/PDP-10/muddle/tree/ats/its), I can now successfully link a MUDDLE binary!\r\n\r\n```\r\n:mid289 ts m323f_midas 323\r\n:midas ts msstk_stink 2\r\n:xfile xfile muddle\r\n(snip lots of output)\r\n:msstk\r\nMMUDDLE LOADER$@$$\r\n(snip list of files)\r\n*MMUDDLE BIN$Y$$\r\n:KILL\r\n*:job muddle\r\n!\r\n*:load muddle bin\r\n*$g\r\n.VAL 0; EBPUR1>>MOVEI 1,-1(5)   1/   IMAGFL+31   E.A. _ 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is about 110,000 instructions into its initialisation process, so it's making some progress at least! DDT doesn't seem to see all the symbols, although STINK can print a list of them with S$$. Single-stepping through the first few instructions fails because (in klh10, at least) it clobbers location 20, which MUDDLE wants to read early on, but setting a later breakpoint (SETUP+12) is OK.\r\n\r\nI've had a look at the TOPS-20 build files from <mdl.int> and there doesn't seem to be anything particular they're doing in terms of purification - the two binary patches they apply are to set the version number (which VCREATE can do automatically on ITS, in theory) and to twiddle another parameter that doesn't apply to ITS."

    "body": "Some more details have been published in the New Zork Times:\r\n\r\n> Although people could get runnable Zorks, they couldn’t get sources. We tried two approaches to protecting the sources (remember, there was no protection of any sort on  DM):  they  were  normally  kept  encrypted;  and  we  patched  the  system  to  protect the directory where we kept the sources (named CFS, for either “Charles F. Stanley” or “Computer Fantasy and Simulation”). This worked pretty well, but was finally beaten by a system hacker from Digital: using some archaic ITS documentation (there’s never been any other kind), he was able to figure out how to modify the running operating system. Being clever, he was also able to figure out how our patch to protect the source directory worked. Then it was just a matter of decrypting the sources, but that was soon reduced to figuring out the key we’d used. Ted had no trouble getting machine time; he just found a new TOPS-20 machine that was undergoing final testing, and started a program that tried every key until it got something that looked like text. After less than a day of crunching, he had a readable copy of the source. We had to concede that anyone who’d go to that much trouble deserved it. "

I traced through the initialisation process, and fixed a number of problems:\r\n\r\n- The crash I was seeing yesterday was because ILOOP, which copies objects into \"pure\" storage after the end of the code, was running off the end of memory. The pure section was configured to start at BOT=700000 and it looks like it's running about 2000 words over; I've set it to 600000 for now (as MUDDLE's comments indicate that used to be its value), but I guess you could get away with 670000 or similar.\r\n\r\n- It should have printed `MUDDLE INITIALIZATION` by that point, and it hadn't. The syscall to open the TTY needed fixing (looks like a copy-and-paste error).\r\n\r\n- `FATAL ERROR CAN'T CREATE SQUOZE FILE`. It expects the MUDSAV; directory to exist; it'll write various files there (e.g. the GC code, which it maps in when needed).\r\n\r\n- `FATAL ERROR CANT FIXUP INTERPRETER`. The binary we've written so far needs to be MUDSAV;TS MUDG, in PDUMP format; MUDDLE opens the file and reads the page map out of it. So you can't use STINK's Y command, you have to drop into DDT with D and :pdump it. The MUDG name is derived from MUDDLE's version number, which should be written into MUDSTR before dumping, but it works without for now.\r\n\r\n- `FATAL ERROR INITM -- CAN'T PURIFY HIGH CORE`. By this point it's written out its executables and tried swapping in the GC, so it's mostly working. This is the last CORBLK call in PURIMP failing, trying to make all the pure-code pages read-only. I don't know why it doesn't work (any ideas?) -- so I've commented it out... which gets it to the final valret happily.\r\n\r\nI haven't tried anything more complex than arithmetic with MUDDLE yet, so it's quite likely more stuff is broken. All the changes above on the [ats/its](https://github.com/PDP-10/muddle/commits/ats/its) branch; it'd be helpful if someone else could try building it to check I've not left anything out.\r\n\r\nI found another bug in MIDAS as well: using the JRST [stuff... ? JRST .+1] idiom for a skippable block doesn't work in RELOCATABLE mode, because it treats . as the location inside the constant. Fortunately MUDDLE doesn't use this!"
