    "body": "I'm not crazy about this scheme. It was much easier to go to one place (build/build.tcl) to do all the build steps (yes, I know, one big global function isn't great and modularization is good).  Now, there all the individual pieces are spread out over oodles of files. Some stuff is build in build/build.tcl and other stuff is built in xfiles. You have to search to find out where something is built. Sometimes there are files that happen to be part of bootstrapping some piece of software, but are actually independent prerequisites and might be used for other pieces of software. For example, to build INQUIR, I needed a bunch of FASL files, which I built from source. However, while these are prerequisites for getting INQUIR built, they really are completely independent of INQUIR and other programs also depend on them. Putting them in an INQUIR-specific build file is arbitrary.  Hiding prerequisites in some XFILE obscures their independence. \r\n\r\nAlso, I don't like the fact that programs that require input other than from DDT have to be built using a different mechanism.  (Is this really true, by the way?)\r\n\r\nIn any case, I understand that it is nice that parts of the build can be done in ITS. I just don't like that we have to split things up into those that can be built in ITS and those that can't, and that all the parts that can are split up into so many files.  I'll get over it, though."

The code in INFO;INFO EMACS is supposed to be setting things up so that when ^R mode is entered, it executes those commands.\r\n\r\nOf course, this doesn't explain why these are not executed on INFO startup, but you wouldn't see them being executed at dump time.\r\n\r\nIf you start up SYS2;TS INFO (=> EMACS;TSINFO >), and then type `$xInfo Enter<cr>`, you do actually enter info mode correctly.  So something is preventing that string (set up at dump time) from being executed."

Well, U.S. copyright law has changed over the years.  Software wasn't copyrightable in the U.S. prior to 1980, so those parts of ITS that date from before then can be considered in the public domain (although they should have a note in them about that so that people can know their status.)\r\n\r\nEven once software became copyrightable in the United States, there were some formalities required like adding a copyright notice. This isn't a requirement anymore though: In today's world software is automatically copyrighted just by virtue of having been made. Back in the day not including one resulted in a loss of copyright. So, the other components of ITS (from 1980 and later) could also be considered public domain if they lack a copyright notice. They, too, should also have a note in them about that so that people can know their status.\r\n\r\nGiven how much U.S. copyright law has changed over the years Cornell has published a nice little chart that people can follow to determine the copyright status of things, based on when it was published (I propose using the dates associated with the files to know when, unless someone has a better idea.)\r\n http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm\r\n\r\nFor everything else, like contributions from today get an automatic \"All Rights Reserved\" copyright regardless of whether the person wants that or not, I propose adopting a similar license as what MIT did for the rest of ITS: Using GPLv2-or-any-later-version (although, really, upgrading to GPLv3.) This would make the licensing sane and consistent across the whole operating system.\r\n\r\nThis could be added in a note in the Contibuting document. Perhaps adding something like the Developer Certificate of Origin, which is licensed as CC BY-SA: http://web.archive.org/web/20070306195036/http://osdlab.org/newsroom/press_releases/2004/2004_05_24_dco.html and then have people use Git's \"signed-off-by\" feature as a way to document their assent."

I actually think it would be nice to document \"how to build and install\" each of the components. But this could be in a document.  I think some facts that might be nice to collect are:  the set of all source files needed, where the binaries go, where the TS executables go, what links need to be where, and what data files or other dependencies each component has. If you're game, we could create some .md document and start populating it when we add new components, and as time allows, backfill it with all the info for components we've already built."

I've not been able to find anyone that would know if the contents of the machine were archived away somewhere or not. Finding that would be a big help.\r\n\r\nMuddle was eventually ported to Apollo/Domain workstations and VAX. It's also known that Muddle ran on BSD UNIX either 4.2 or 4.3 as well as A/UX. To my knowledge none of this has survived to the present day but if it did show up it would be a great boon.\r\n\r\nI talked to Dave Lebling almost a year ago. He indicated:\r\n\r\n> The \"MIM\" (Muddle in Muddle) runtime base was indeed written in C. It loaded and ran additional runtime code written in Muddle and compiled by MIMC (\"MIM Compiler\"). I thought all but the C runtime base layer was on the (in)famous \"Infocom Disk\" which can be found in various places on the web.\r\n> \r\n> What is as far as I know truly lost is the old PDP-10/Tops-20 Muddle Compiler and MIMC. Still, Muddle is not exactly as hard to compile as C++, to pick one example. (Easy for me to say as I wasn't the compiler writer!) My recollection is that most of the complexity of it was in code optimization, because Muddle ran on machines with very little memory.\r\n\r\nI have found that John Scott from http://ascii.textfiles.com/ has a copy of the drive in the form of a 150MB zip file, which contains source code, but he has been unwilling to share anything."

    "body": "Oh, and to tack on some more info to clear up acronyms: What made it easier to port to other machines was work on making a so-called \"Machine Independent Muddle\", or MIM for short, which began in the early 1980s. MIM was also said to stand for Muddle-in-Muddle. These terms refer to the work done to make the Muddle interpreter, which was originally written in assembly language, more portable and easier to maintain. Part of this effort involved implementing a runtime base layer in C, with higher things written in directly in Muddle, hence \"Muddle-in-Muddle.\" It also refers to the creation of a virtual machine in which to run Muddle programs (not the Z-Machine that Infocom made though.) There is some info on this virtual machine on the \"Status of MDL Project\" message at http://www.saildart.org/LISP.MTG[TIM,LSP] but this seems to be all of the information that survives on the VM.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am probably rambling on but it's good to find others with similar interests."

    "body": "A few points:\r\n- I don't think Muddle ever ran on the Apollo. We had a BSD VAX version done at MIT, and an A/UX version at Infocom. In both cases, there were two compilers: MIMC, which generated what I guess you'd call virtual machine code (think LLVM's IR), and MIMOC, which generated machine language from that. The 68020 architecture for A/UX was close enough to the VAX that the MIMOC for it was not difficult; of course Apple went with System V rather than BSD, so there were some runtime issues to deal with. There was a DEC-20 version of MIM first, because that's what we had. Infocom never used the VAX version--DEC-20 until we switched to A/UX, with a Sun file server (but no code running on it).\r\n- Never once heard it called \"Muddle-in-Muddle\"--MIM was \"Machine-independent Muddle.\" And there was never a Muddle virtual machine as such; MIMC, as I said, generated virtual machine code, but we never interpreted that directly. Most of the interpreter was written in Muddle, though the interpreter code was not, as I recall, exactly Muddle--there were some cheats.\r\n- I can't find the sources for MIMIMAC, but the DEC-20 (MIMI20) and VAX (MIMIVX) versions of the runtime core were both written in assembler--the DEC-20 because that's what we used, and the VAX because no one wanted to learn C, or figure out how to work C's calling conventions in with Muddle's--it was easier if we controlled the horizontal *and* the vertical. Anyway, these were single, not huge, .MID / .s files.\r\n- I wrote a library that interfaced to X, so we could take advantage of the VS-100 displays (with fiber optic connections back to the computer!) that DEC gave MIT. They tried really hard, once they realized they were getting schooled by Sun and Apollo, but it was too late. We didn't bother with this at Infocom (though A/UX had a somewhat later version of X), and it was strictly for application usage--the Muddle interpreter itself did not have a GUI, but you could build a GUI using it.\r\n- The \"Infocom disk\" appears to have pretty complete sources for the DEC-20 and VAX versions of MIM (runtime core, MIMC, MIMOC, and interpreter), including quite a lot of stuff that was implemented as packages outside the interpreter (VS-100 support), and what looks like the package system for that (not nearly as spiffy as what we had for the original version, because Licklider cared a lot more about that than anyone else).\r\n- IIRC, version 105 was the last version of the classic PDP-10 assembly language Muddle."

    "body": "It never ran on the Apollo? I guess the information from Chris Reeve is not correct then: http://www.saildart.org/LISP.MTG%5BTIM,LSP%5D has that\r\n\r\n> We are going to have Apollo Domains very shortly and we plan to port\r\nMDL to the Domain.  By September 1981 we will have a complete MDL system based\r\non machine independent MDL on the 20 and the Domain.  By the end of calendar\r\n1981 both of these systems will have achieved the same level of reliability\r\nand robustness available on the current MDL.  We intend to bring up MDL on\r\nthe VAX by mid 1982.\r\n\r\nIt seems it was at least an idea then. Perhaps the project never completed or never started? The message was written in future tense after all. That's the same message  where he mentions a virtual machine.\r\n\r\nMy source for saying that MIM was also used as Muddle-in-Muddle comes from the old Emacs source code where Emacs had a Muddle mode to interact with a superior Muddle process. A copy of part is at http://www.mit.edu/afs.new/athena/contrib/epoch/lisp/mim-mode.el where \"Mim (MDL in MDL)\" is mentioned a few times. Perhaps unofficial but I mentioned it anyway as it's something that came up in my research into Muddle. http://www.mit.edu/afs.new/athena/contrib/epoch/lisp/medit.el is the one that has the reference to mit-ajax.\r\n\r\nThe reason I am saying more work was done on Muddle after what was described in those documents is because I've found someone's 116 page thesis buried in the archives at the MIT Library. It describes a device-independent graphics manager for Muddle and is dated in 1982 while the last version of \"The MDL Programming Languge\" book is dated in 1979. It says things like \"Christopher Reeve, one of the original implementers of the language MDL, modified the MIM compiler to compile graphics instructions, and helped in the debugging of the Motorola M68000 assembly programs.\" Coincidentally, the Apollo machines used Motorola 68k CPUs. Plus, the sample source code listings in the thesis contain calls to functions that are not mentioned in the 1979 book.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to reconcile your comments and Dave Lebling's comments about the runtime base layer but I suppose it doesn't matter what language it was written in."

But for now, it makes things easier if we can compare the DB and PI builds (file-by-file, directory-by-directory) to measure progress and determine when we have succeeded\r\n\r\nI feel it's better to do the updates as we go, because the amount of work to get to a perfectly finished state replicating PI is so large.  We may end up never getting there.  And then the reorganizations will never be done.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest we try to eat the cake and have it too.  Add a commit that records the files in a state that replicates the original system, and then another commit with updates.  It can be an individual choice whether this update is done right away, or much later."

However, I find it very frustrating that I don't have my EJS directory automatically created when I boot a new version, and some of my INIT files. I frequently boot with a custom KLH10 INI file that mounts a tape from ES-ITS, and then I use load (manually) to load up my EJS directory. While this change is nice, we end up getting things in a USER directory -- and you still have to create your home directory and populate it -- unless, of course, you log in as \"user\".

There is a ton of useless stuff in the PI distribution, as well as lots of old versions of sources and binaries. I don't think we should duplicate that. Also, i think we'll know when we are at the point of reorganizing. Once we've produced all the executables and binaries that we can, and we've included all relevant doc, we can declare ourselves ready to clean up. We should enter tickets for all cleanup to document our intent and expectations. \n\nAnyway, that's just my opinion.
