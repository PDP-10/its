I would _assume_ that it ran ITS.\r\n> \r\n> I don't recall if the physical remains stayed until the KA's were de-commissioned, or of they were removed prior to that - I suspect they stayed, since they were mixed in with the KA's - in the case of AI at least, wired in together - but don't remember exactly. I don't recall if the I/O bus was shared between the two CPUs on the DM machines, the way it was on the AI KA and PDP-6.\r\n> \r\n> The DM PDP-6 was part of the DM KA 'assembly' - DM was in two rows (front and back) to the right of the right-hand door from the lobby into the machine room. IIRC, the PDP-6 was in the front row, to the right? of the KA CPU. (The back row contained memory boxes - a mix of different DEC memories. I don't recall where the tape and disk controllers were - or the disk drives. I seem to vaguely recall a few boxes to the left of the KA CPU? Maybe there are some pictures of the MAC machine room that will show it.)\r\n"

Richard Greenblatt and Thomas Knight made an heroic effort to bring up an ITS time-sharing system compatible with that on the Artificial Intelligence Group's machine. The new file system they created was given to the Dynamic Modeling group and tripled their effective disk utilization.\r\n>\r\n> The remainder of the memory arrived in December. In January Systems Concepts installed a pager compatible with the one on the Artificial Intelligence machine. As a result, the Mathlab machine is able to use the latest versions of the Artificial Intelligence time-sharing systems.\r\n\r\nAI memo 238, April 1972:\r\n> The ITS system is to be used by the Project MAC Mathlab group on their own PDP-10 Computer. This should increase the incentive for real modularity which has been lacking with a one installation system (Actually the Project MAC Dynamic Modelling Group uses a non-paged early offshoot of ITS on their PDP-10.)\r\n> \r\n> Much of the work in setting up the initial Mathlab system is being done by Richard L. Greenblatt.\r\n\r\nRFC 366 from 28 June 1972 says \"During this period the MIT Math Lab PDP-10 (Network address 198) became a server.\""

    "body": "**AI KA10**\r\n\r\nProject MAC Progress Report IV, 1967:\r\n> It appears that at some time within the next year, it will be desirable to add a second processor to our central computer, the PDP-6. The initial selection of the PDP-6 computer was based in part on the fact that it was the only major-machine available that had built-in room for expansion, not only in input-output channels (which have grown steadily) but also in memory channels and in additional central-processor capacity. The manufacturer has continued to develop this concept and can offer a completely program-compatible second processor. This new processor, called the PDP-10, is about twice as fast as the present PDP-6, and if added with a small amount of its own very fast memory ought to triple the system's bulk computation rate.\r\n\r\nRFC 254 from October 1971 says:\r\n\r\n> The MIT PDP-10(AI) system uses the ITS operating system and is similar to the MIT PDP-10(DMCG) system.  At present the host is not connected to the ARPANET.\r\n\r\nRFC 342 from 15 May 1972 adds AI as a Network User.  In RFC 344 is had become a server.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PDP-10/its/pull/403#issuecomment-395183650 has the time AI started running TCP/IP:\r\n> MIT-AI started running ITS 1312 on December 31 at 21:03-EST\r\n\r\n> MSG:  AI     1     \r\n> Date: 05/02/83 13:51:15\r\n> From: CSTACY @ MIT-MC\r\n> \r\n> The AI KA10 has been flushed, please update your programs.\r\n\r\n> Date: Sat,  8 Feb 86 03:15:22 EST\r\n> From: \"Pandora B. Berman\" <CENT%AI.AI.MIT.EDU@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU>\r\n> Subject: Reports of ITS death have been highly exaggerated\r\n> To: macrakis@HARVARD.HARVARD.EDU, sollins@XX.LCS.MIT.EDU\r\n> cc: KS-ITS%AI.AI.MIT.EDU@MC.LCS.MIT.EDU\r\n> Message-ID: <[AI.AI.MIT.EDU].12905.860208.CENT>\r\n> \r\n> the semi-original AI (that is, the KA-10 rather than the PDP-6) was flushed 3 years ago. the hardware was given to a bunch of hackers from Concourse (an MIT alternative undergrad program) -- after it walked across the street to Bldg. 20, the KA still ran, but had no memory, since its latest memory incarnation was all modified LispM Mem boards, which were given to needy Lispms when the Lab flushed the machine. i think the Concourse hackers have since had access to more of these Mem boards, but they have not (alas!) managed to bring the KA up in full-fledged fashion.\r\n\r\n> the AIKA went to the concourse computer club folks (an MIT student org.). we told them to tell us if they later decided they didn't want it any more.  when peter lothberg came over here to pick up MC, his shipping container had plenty of room left, so we checked to see whether the CCC folks still had it/still wanted it/it still worked in any fashion. we were horrified to discover that Gill Pratt had just sold it to a scrap dealer for its materials, apparently to make room for some sort of solar-car project he was then involved in, without any notice to us whatsoever.\r\n"

    "body": "CENT; TAPES SAVE\r\n> Project MAC, whence descended the AI Lab and LCS, developed a highly unusual operating system called ITS (Incompatible Timesharing System).  For many years it was the only, or the chief, OS used at the labs, so most of the seminal work done here was done on machines running ITS.  Full ITS first ran on the AI PDP6, and was ported to the DM PDP6.  Later, PDP10s became available, and the labs acquired some of the earliest ones -- the AI-KA10 (AI Lab's machine), the ML KA-10 (used by the MathLab, Theory of Computation, Automatic Programming, and certain other LCS gruops), and the DMS KA-10 (Dynamic Modeling systems, also used by certain other LCS groups); these replaced the PDP-6s, which were slowly phased out.  The well-known MACSYMA program was started on the AI-KA, moved to the ML-KA when that machine case online and there underwent much development, and finally needed some space to really run.  At that point the Macsyma Consortium was established and bought MC, the first KL-10A installed outside DEC."

We could just mail them that tape, and a description of ITS DUMP format (which is trivial).\r\n"

Thanks to things like the Berne Convention, which most countries of the world have signed on to, you get it automatically whether you want it or not and whether the notice is there or not. The version control system can be used to keep track of who did what when and figure out who has copyright on what stuff, should that become necessary.\r\n\r\nThis only works when someone is committing their own stuff. If stuff is being committed \"on behalf of\" others (which seems common in this project, due to importing software and documentation made by others), it's definitely a good idea to still add this so as to keep an appropriate record of who has copyright on what. (This is why I added those MIT copyright notices into those files.) Going with centralized copyright notices could be done, if it were structured appropriately so that people could still know whose copyright applied to what (which can be muddied with the whole committing \"on behalf of\" other people.) MIT doesn't necessarily have a copyright over everything in this repository, for example, and you wouldn't necessarily want to mislead people to think that they did. And if the centralized method would involve keeping track of whose copyright applies to what (at least when adding stuff that isn't your own) you may as well just add the line into the file in question."

    "body": "Hi @36bit. I'm happy to leave up to those of you who are more informed in this area to determine whether we need copyright notices on all the files that we didn't author or whether we can use some general, blanket copyright notices. If you think we need them on all files, I'll go along with it.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think obscuring the original file date/times is a bad idea.  So even if we do add copyright notices to all the source files, I think we should endeavor to have the date/times reflect that last time they were modified -- since we have that information now in the tapes we've used to retrieve these sources. Since \"itstar\" has the means of restoring date/times on files, we can leverage that when we load source tapes into our ITS system during a build.\r\n\r\nWe should decide, soon, whether we need individual copyright notices, and what the content should be. If we decide to put individual copyright notices, coming up with that text now would allow us to start applying it all source files as we add them. Then, we need to determine whether we need to add any copyright notices (GPLv3?) to any source files we modify. "

MIT released (some) of ITS under the GPL. Still others parts are free of copyright restrictions and in the public domain (in the U.S.) because they were not published with a copyright notice, which was a requirement of U.S. copyright law at that time (it's not anymore, but that it used to be works to our advantage in this case.) Still others have various other licenses (like INQUIR) which are almost but not quite [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)."

(By the way, this fact probably negates the idea that it was \"published\" during the pre-Berne USA Copyright era.) Anyway, ITS has never been considered to be an IP asset back in the day, and I really don't think any modern day MIT lawyers are going to come looking for trouble about it today.\r\n\r\nSo: legally, very murky.\r\nReality: hack away and have fun and absolutely *whatever*.\r\n\r\nIf MIT did an ITS release with GPL (where is that document?) it certainly indicates their modern intentions with regard to the IP. I would not worry about other MIT Copyright notices that conflict with the GPL license distribution authorization (even though I've never seen it).\r\n\r\nDefinitively clearing up all Copyright issues on any files that might be part of ITS would probably be very difficult and expensive and unlikely to get done. The only thing I'd worry about is files that might seem to be part of some ITS distribution, but which were not really part of ITS (e.g. not MIT's IP).\r\n\r\nINQUIR is part of ITS.\r\nI assure you that the libraries it uses are also not a problem, either.\r\n\r\n"

And it's not that the license of INQUIR prohibits distribution (it does allow it.) So the project isn't running afoul of MIT copyright by having it. It just falls short of the free software definition, which is the part I'm hoping to change.\r\n\r\n> If MIT did an ITS release with GPL (where is that document?)\r\n\r\nThe GPLed stuff from MIT can be found at http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/ftpdir/its/\r\nIt's specifically under GPLv2-or-any-later-version, which makes upgrading to v3 very simple.\r\n\r\n> And there might even be material which didn't belong to MIT\r\n\r\nThere may very well be other stuff that does not belong to MIT, given that they seemed to have a somewhat open access policy for ITS. This doesn't necessarily make things any worse; it actually helps. If someone outside MIT was submitting stuff to the folks at MIT for inclusion into ITS that certainly counts as publishing their work, since it allowed other people (besides the individual that made the program) to get copies of the software on the computers at MIT, since they themselves put/sent it there for people to use.\r\n\r\nThe open access policy also helps with stuff also helps with stuff written directly by MIT staff and installed on the system. People outside of MIT would have had the same access to those programs on the machine.\r\n\r\nIn both cases the lack of notice then works in our favor in the pre-Berne era."
