    "body": "Hi Lars,\n\nI’m still a bit confused.  I submitted a single pull request, and expected it to encompass the two commits I had pushed to my branch.  What should I have done differently in the situation where I first tested my tree locally and found it working fine, then did a “commit” that missed a few files, the fixed this by issuing another commit?  In fact, I did do two “pushes”, since I realized after the first push that I forgot some files.  I realize that this caused Travis to perform two builds, the first, which should have failed, and the second, which should have succeded. It is usually difficult to know that a commit is incomplete, since the build works fine locally, but won’t when pulled via CI.  True, a “git status” would have revealed the missing files before I did a “git push”, but I can’t believe that, in general, this doesn’t happen in the real world.  People often have to “fix” a commit/push when they realize they forgot something or had a bug that only shows up in CI.  \n\nAs far as I know, I should have had a “squeaky-clean” pull request.  I submitted only one pull request, which should have encompassed both commits.  What did I do wrong?  I authored the pull request, and waited until Travis said everything was ok and then I submitted the request.  In fact, I didn’t see any failed build there — it showed everything good.  What should I have done differently?\n\nRegarding making the TS PEEK link a separate commit — understood.  I’ll be more careful.  \n\nBut please do commend on the issue of a “single pull request” that encompasses two commits, because I may have a big misunderstanding regarding Git that, although I’ve used Git for several years now, I’ve somehow missed!  :-)\n\n— Eric\n\n> On Nov 18, 2016, at 10:42, Lars Brinkhoff notifications@github.com wrote:\n> \n> It's possible to completely rewrite pull requests.

    "body": "Sure, I'm happy to go on at length about this, if you're willing to listen!  I just hope I can explain in a way that makes sense.\n\nYou did one commit, pushed it, and made pull request.  Then you realized something was amiss, and you wanted to fix it.  You made another commit and pushed that.  Travis is happy.\n\nWhat I would have done at this point, is to go back and fix the first failing commit.  I would edit the commit so the build no longer failed.  When everything is done, I would do `git push -f` to forcibly update the branch.  GitHub will notice this, and update the pull request accordingly.\n\nI have learned these practices from the open-source world.  Linux, GCC, binutils, etc, all do one form or another of this.  Twenty years ago, there was no git, and changes where submitted as a series of patches to a mailing list.  The changes were scrutinized by the maintainers, and if anything in a patch was bad, the whole series was turned down, and you were asked to fix it and resubmit a new series.  This is much like how GitHub works today.  A pull request is like a patch series, and a commit is like a patch.\n\nWhy go to all this trouble?  Because often, a bug surfaces, and you will have to back to a commit and try to figure out what is does, and the intent behind it.  If a commit is simple, this makes the job much easier.  If a commit is broken, and relies on another commit to make it work, it's harder to understand.  You also have to study the other commit.\n"

    "body": "On Mon, Nov 21, 2016 at 2:33 PM, Lars Brinkhoff\r\n<notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n> @ethandicks Did you use a PDP-10 MDL interpreter when you ported Zork to z-code?\r\n\r\nNot at first - I just read the MDL code, got the MDL books from MIT\r\nPress and learned enough MDL to understand what the code was doing.\r\nFortunately, despite the massive visual differences between Inform and\r\nMDL, because MDL is the ancestor of ZIL which compiles to Z-machine\r\nbyte code, and Inform compiles to Z-machine byte code, when one needs\r\nto, say, generate a room with attributes and properties, the resulting\r\nbyte code is quite similar, so it's somewhat easy to \"rephrase\" a MDL\r\nproblem into Inform.\r\n\r\nI did later do some side-by-side testing by running the original\r\n36-bit Zork on one of the machines Rich Alderson runs.  I did\r\nnot compile the MDL I have into a running game, but I did\r\nrun 20+ year old game files to elicit various responses.\r\n\r\nSo the Inform port is a re-creation, but it's a section-by-section\r\nre-creation with very similar logic and structure, but not 100%\r\nidentical.  It's using the Inform parser code, not the MDL parser\r\ncode, for example, but with various responses and some structure\r\nbackported from the MDL to Inform.\r\n\r\n-ethan\r\n"

Did anyone write such a tool when the DM users moved to XX?\r\n\r\nMoon replied:\r\n> I don't know of any way to do it, but the format is so simple.  Each file on the tape is a file (i.e. there are tape marks between the files) and just has some header information at the front."

DM was unusual in having a 9-track tape drive, IIRC; AI, ML, and MC, again IIRC, had 7.\r\n\r\nThe original Muddle compiler wasn't really specific to ITS (it didn't generate any system calls), but when we moved to XX there was a new implementation of the interpreter (primarily written in Muddle, rather than assembly language), and a more modern compiler to go with it. But I don't think we had to change source code much at all to get Zork running on XX."
