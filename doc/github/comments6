Guy L. Steele and David A. Moon rewrote the microcode for the machine so that it simulated the pager on the Mathlab KA-10 and our ITS operating system was in operation in November.\r\n\r\n> Date: Thu,  8 Sep 88 21:39:25 EDT\r\n> From: \"Pandora B.

It provided Macsyma, the symbolic algebra system, to researchers all over the world, and mail gatewaying and mailing list support to a large fraction of the Arpanet.  Things continued in this fashion from 1975 to 1983.\r\n> \r\n> When the Macsyma Consortium dissolved in 1983, MC turned to providing cycles for MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science, and continued supporting much of the Arpanet's mail service.  But the machine itself was growing old and cranky.  In 1986, the mail services were moved to a smaller, more maintainable machine (a KS-10), and the name \"MC\" was moved with them. But the KL-10 continued to run under the new name \"MX\".\r\n> \r\n> Now the end has come.  MX was down cold for several months, and has only been revived recently to copy some old 7-track tapes.  LCS can't keep MX any longer -- it needs the space for other purposes.  So the KL is being sent to the Home for Aged But Beloved PDP-10s; a crack team of hardware hackers will arrive next week to dismantle it and take it back with them to Sweden."

Muddle did not take advantage of 18-bit addresses even on the KA-10 (pointers were two words, with the header having type code and, for some types, length), so there wouldn't be any changes in pointer sizes to deal with, anyway."

    "body": "While I like the historical charm, I don't like the ugliness of having INSRT files in all these random directories, and, quite frankly, that charm is really only appreciated by a few.  If you bring up an ITS system, it is a big ugly to have bawden, eak, gren, ksc, mrc, rms, sra, alan, cstacy, ecc, gz, klh, and rwk directories (I know host of these people and hope that I won't offend them greatly by my blasphemous comment).  There is no logical reason why anyone would look in these directories for system sources, and the fact that there are relevant sources there can only be discerned through examining the source or by attempting to assemble/compile programs.  I think we could have a document included in the distribution that maps the original locations to the new locations to maintain the history.  (Geez, maybe we could even have a script that creates all these personal directories and copies the files back to them for those who really wanted it that way!). "

If so, I think the additional sources should go into a new EMACS2.  Or are you worried about not being able to have all the :EJ files in EMACS?  Perhaps we'll have to create an EMACLB (emacs library) directory or some other directory (EMACSn) for the additional :EJ files and update the autoload properties (if necessary) for those to support loading :EJ files from both EMACS; and the new directory.  \r\n\r\nOur initial goal, however, should be to include all libraries we can (assuming source can be found) for which there were :EJ files (or \\[...\\] files) in EMACS; This, by definition, can't overflow EMACS (or the EMACS1 source directory), if these binaries were already there in the original distribution.

Many programs are missing, and even more source code.\r\n\r\nThere were regular backups made since at least 1971, to 7-track tapes.  When the 7-track drives started to fail, a selection of the tapes were taken to DEC's Manyard site and transferred to 9-track tapes.  Later, the process repeated itself, and a selection of 9-track tapes were transferred to more modern media.  Some tapes were unreadable and some were only incremental backups.  The result now sits somewhere inside MIT's digital archives."
