I'm interested in how early games like this were exchanged between institutions so I don't mind doing a bit of duplicate detective work.\r\n\r\nWe could simplify the build process by having BEG0 read a single filename string, and open it using the SOPEN call (and fix the missing TTY open at the same time).

The code still works by chance, because the value in that location by default is 2, so it just ends up checking every odd number as a possible factor (and the TRC/HRRI overwrite A which doesn't matter).\r\n\r\nSo I wonder if that version never got installed, because the intention was to speed it up on the KL by running the inner loop from main memory rather than the registers, but it actually ended up being slower as it was testing more factors..."

    "body": "I had a further look at this last night, based on @larsbrinkhoff's work; here's my updated code: https://github.com/PDP-10/muddle/tree/ats/its\r\n\r\nI've persuaded all the MIDAS files from the newer version to assemble with MIDAS 458. I've also fixed the included copy of STINK and tested that it works with a simple example. However, for any of the source files that .INSRTs MUDDLE >, loading the resulting REL into STINK fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*:stink\r\nSTINK.201\r\n\r\n*MEVAL$L$$\r\nbad format: symbol missing\r\nUndefined Global Assignment 6056 VECLOC\r\nUndefined Global Assignment 6056 SQULOC\r\nUndefined Global Assignment 6056 TVLOC\r\nUndefined Global Assignment 6056 VECTOP\r\nMultiply Defined Global 7 *7UV\r\nMultiply Defined Global 4 SQULOC\r\nMultiply Defined Global 2 *2IX\r\nMultiply Defined Global 4 TVLOC\r\nMultiply Defined Global 15 VECLOC\r\nUndefined Global Assignment 6056 VECTOP\r\nMultiply Defined Global 7 *7UV\r\nMultiply Defined Global 2 *2IX\r\nMultiply Defined Global 4 TVLOC\r\n[snip dozens of similar lines]\r\nbad format: symbol missing\r\nbad format: symbol undefined\r\nbad format: symbol missing\r\nbad format: symbol undefined\r\nbad format: symbol undefined\r\nNon-existent Memory\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth STINK 201 and the included STINK fail in the same way; the former has more readable error messages. Loading a file that doesn't use MUDDLE >, e.g. CONST, seems to be fine.\r\n\r\nThe symbols it's complaining about seem to be those that are used in LOC constructs in MUDDLE >'s macros. I wonder if something's bitrotted in MIDAS's RELOCA support - perhaps an older version of MIDAS would be worth trying? Alternatively, could we persuade MIDAS to build it in one hit by constructing a file that includes all the other sources (removing the RELOCAs and adjusting the .INSRTs)?\r\n\r\nI've also done the same fixups for the 1973 version: https://github.com/PDP-10/muddle/tree/ats/its73\r\nBut this has exactly the same problem when loading the resulting files into STINK, and it looks like it's not complete; e.g. it's missing VCREAT (which is in the Twenex version) and DISPLY (which isn't).\r\n\r\nThere are two binaries in the 1973 version, TS MUDDLE and TS OMUDDL, neither of which seem to work right for simple examples. So even if we get it to link there may be more work ahead...\r\n\r\nIt looks like the source belongs in MUDSYS;, from the .INSRT in STINK."

Could we reduce the input delays in build.tcl for parts of the build process?\r\n\r\n- As Eric suggests above, modularise: build an initial base system with MIDAS etc., then clone the emulated disk image and run several emulated PDP-10s in parallel, each of which builds a group of software and dumps the results to tape. A final step loads all the tapes into the final system. (Probably not too hard to specify in make.)\r\n\r\n- Stick with one emulated PDP-10, but run multiple expect processes talking to different emulated terminal lines, so we can build multiple groups of software in parallel on it."

Not part of the interpreter, and not dependent on the Muddle-specific tool chain to be built.\r\n\r\nI don’t remember that convention for fn2, but it was 40 years ago.\r\n                -ta\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Lars Brinkhoff [mailto:notifications@github.com]\r\nSent: Thursday, 12 April, 2018 16:11\r\nTo: PDP-10/its <its@noreply.github.com>\r\nCc: Anderson, Timothy A. <taa@stresearch.com>; Mention <mention@noreply.github.com>\r\nSubject: Re: [PDP-10/its] Muddle (#665)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, could we persuade MIDAS to build it in one hit by constructing a file that includes all the other sources\r\n\r\nYes, that's an option I have considered.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the source belongs in MUDSYS;\r\n\r\nThanks, I didn't notice that. We only have tiny scraps of information from DM ITS. There's a backup listing with these files:\r\n\r\nMUDSYS MAIN   MCR317    18      1/27/77 17:59:27.5\r\n\r\nMUDSYS MAIN   MCR318    18      1/28/77 10:10:21.5\r\n\r\nMUDSYS MAPPUR MCR185    18      1/31/77 13:59:58.5\r\n\r\nWe recognize MAIN and MAPPUR. Apparently the DynaMod fn2 naming convention with XXXNNN has appeared here. There's also XXFILE MTA224 and GUNNER MTA381. I don't know what MCR or MTA means.

    "body": "I've modified a copy of STINK (using JOTTO's neat printing macro!) to show details about the blocks, symbols and linker instructions it sees in its input. This makes it much clearer what's going on, since there's a very direct correspondence between what MIDAS sees in phase 2 and what gets written to the REL. So a bit more progress:\r\n\r\n- When STINK says \"bad format: symbol missing\", what it means is that the MIDAS source contained an EXPUNGE for a symbol that didn't exist. I've fixed one instance of this (DOTYPS in MUDDLE >) but it looks like there are others. It also looks like recovering from this error might be messing up STINK 201's internal state somehow; the older STINK 1 didn't try to recover.\r\n\r\n- I think the \"Multiply Defined Global\" messages for TVLOC etc. may be harmless. They are indeed defined multiple times, because the macros in MUDDLE redefine them to keep track of the list of definitions they're building up.\r\n\r\n- The \"Undefined Global Assignment\" messages for TVLOC etc. are because these are redefined by the MUDDLE macros, but the initial definition is only in SPECS. So you have to load SPECS REL into STINK before you load anything else. "

    "body": "The code in STINK to recover from \"bad format: symbol missing\" is definitely wrong: it needs to read a second word from the input (PUSHJ P,RPB) like the successful path would do.\r\n\r\nFixing that in the old and new versions of STINK gets a bit further; you can load PURE and SPECS, and then whatever you load next causes STINK 201 to print \"Non-existant Memory\" (and STINK 1 to crash at UNTHR+2, which is the same thing).\r\n\r\nAfter a lot of tracing through STINK (and assuming I'm following this correctly), this happens in response to a local symbol definition in the type 3 block that's produced by the .LNKOT directive in the END macro. The block has previously included a link request code for the same local symbol, which should point to a linked list of addresses that the real address of the symbol should be written into. When STINK sees the definition, it tries to works its way through the linked list, but runs into a nonsense pointer (and ends up trying to interpret a string constant as an address).\r\n\r\nThe pointer in the link request is to a location that's later inside the same type 3 block -- which hasn't been read into memory yet because we've not got that far... so this looks like MIDAS's fault."

    "body": "A couple questions:  Where should the executable go?  When you build NGAME, you have to tell it where the executable is.  So the executable could go anywhere.  The data file used by the game is burned into the executable just prior to pdumping it, so it basically lives where it was when it was built.  One possibility is to put the sources in GAMES; (this is where the original ADVENT source is, as well as JOTTO and WUMPUS). Historically, the sources were not available (they were encrypted in an archive in MC:EJS;).  The executable was in an archive in EJS; or BMT1;  Now, we don't have to hide the sources, so I recommend we put them either in EJS; or GAMES;.  The executable could go in SYS3; -- where we've put the original ADVENT, or it could go in EJS; or GAMES;.  One of the very confusing things is that we have three versions of ADVENT.  The sources for the original game are a single file (ADVENT.F4).  The sources for the 350-point version of advent are two files (ADVSB 2 and ADVSR 1) + the data file in ADVDB 1.  The sources for the 448-point version of advent are two files (MAIN 3 and SUBRS 16) + the data file in DB 2.  Creating the 448-point version renames the datafile (to FT01 DAT).  So if we put all of these sources in GAMES; it will be a bit confusing for people who are looking at it.  One possibility is to create three archives in GAMES; (or EJS;) AR1 ADVENT, AR2 ADV350, and AR3 ADV448).  We can put the sources and database in those archives.  We can then, during build, extract the files, build, and then delete them.  That way, there will be no confusion as to which sources go to which version.  \r\n\r\nNow, the 350- and 448-point versions of ADVENT are referenced in NGAME by filenames that are entered at assembly time.  The other games locations are burned into the source (BMT1; or EJS;).  Should I keep them in their historical places or move them to GAMES;?"
