    "body": "Yes, what @larsbrinkhoff said :-)\r\n\r\nSCNV and VERSA can both handle multiple files at once, which saves a bit of time - SCNV converts all * PLT files in the current directory, and VERSA can take multiple filenames separated by commas.\r\n\r\nVERSA writes HARSCN 1, HARSCN 2... into .TEMP.; those are the files you need for gldtopbm. Dump them to a tape and extract with itstar. Drop any that are zero-length; at the moment VERSA writes an empty file when it starts up, which I need to fix. \r\n\r\nThe output is rotated 180 degrees, so do something like this to get a usable file:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngldtopbm <harscn.2 | pnmflip -r180 | pnmtopng >2.png\r\n```"

    "body": "Hi Lars,\n\nI haven't touched it in a couple of years.  As I recall, it was running\nsimple display programs.  I compared the graphical output from a display\ntest program with some other guy with his own emulator and they were\nidentical.  I believe I was thinking about switching back to C as an\nimplementation language as this has better ease of distribution.  Python is\nnot so good in this respect, though it's more cross-platform.  All the\ntools written in python (assembler, test suite, etc) would stay that way.\n\nI suspect you may be interested in Maze War since you are posting from a\nPDP-10 forum.  I haven't thought about Maze War since it needs two Imlacs\nand a PDP-10, all simulated these days, and I don't know how the original\nImlacs talked to the PDP-10.\n\nRoss\n\nOn Wed, 9 May 2561 at 16:47 Lars Brinkhoff <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Hello @rzzzwilson <https://github.com/rzzzwilson>,\n>\n> What's the status on your Imlac emulator?\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/PDP-10/its/issues/870#issuecomment-387685261>, or mute\n> the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAjjA2mDV6CXkEXuSx4mq32jh3oS00Ylks5twrtGgaJpZM4T4Be8>\n> .\n>\n"

I believe the Imlacs were connected through serial lines and used a simple protocol for ASCII text and escape codes to enter graphics mode.  So this use case is probably much simpler than running Maze War.  I don't know if there is an Imlac program for processing such a protocol?\r\n\r\nBy the way, this is posted to GitHub.

    "body": "The picture with Lick is definitely the MIT-DM machine.  It was on the 9th floor of 545 Tech Square.  The system was arrayed in two long rows.  The one in the picture shows the main console.  The equipment rack to the left (behind Lick) was the CPU itself, in those very wide cabinets (much bigger than 19-inch).  There was a large tape drive (9 or 7 track) to the left of the CPU, and eventually also an Ampex ARM-10 core memory.  You can see several micro-tape drives above the CPU and there were some more, to the right of the CPU.  Also a TTY controller built by Steve Morton (SGM@MIT-DM) that we used to connect IMLACs top the PDP-10 at 50-1oo kb/sec (standard RS232 was just too slow).  The old PDP-6 was also to the right.\r\n\r\nParallel to that row of cabinets and behind were memory cabinets and later several disk drives along the outside wall.  The ARPANET IMP was at the right end of that back row.  All that equipment had a wonderful view through the large picture windows all along the back wall!\r\n\r\nIn the picture, you can see a wall off to the left.  That was the start of MIT-AI land, with a workshop area behind the wall and computers, robotic arm etc behind that.  In the early days, the space between the DM PDP-10 and that wall had the E&S Display, as well as a few terminals.  When our group moved and coalesced into our own space on the 2nd floor, the PDP-10 computer stayed behind of course, but the terminals and E&S moved to the 2nd floor.  The space vacated then became home to the MIT-MC and/or ML machines.\r\n\r\nThe 10th (and top) floor was not accessible to the public.  That's where all the HVAC equipment was installed.  Those computers generated a lot of heat, and had to be close to their AC.\r\n\r\nThe picture of the \"E&S LDS-1 at DynaMod\" was taken in the second floor \"terminal room\".  The Imlac pictures were also taken in the second floor.  The hacker on the left is Mike Broos (MSB@MIT-DM); can't tell who's on the right or in the second picture.  \r\n\r\nBTW, we never called it \"DynaMod\".  It was either \"Dynamic Modelling\" or \"DM\".\r\n\r\nOn the 9th floor, to the right of the DM machine, was a wall separating us from the Multics system.    Multics had some massive equipment, which apparently required extra support so it didn't fall through the floor to the 8th floor office.  So there was a huge steel I-beam running under the false floor between the two rows of DM equipment.  Made it very difficult to do things like running cables for memory and I/O busses!\r\n\r\nI spent many hours in front of, around, behind, under, and inside those rows of PDP-10 equipment....\r\n\r\n/Jack Haverty (JFH@MIT-DM)"

    "body": "ITS was the ultimate \"open system\" where anybody could do anything.  But you'd have to face your peers...and that was the basic security mechanism in the small community.\r\n\r\nAt one point, ARPA demanded that the system had to have passwords in order to log in.  So, one of the staff (Mike Brescia) got assigned to make it happen.  Not long after, everyone got a password and you needed to type it in on logging in.   I think that occurred on a Friday.\r\n\r\nOn the following Monday morning, an anonymous MOTD informed everyone that passwords were now required.  But.... if you forgot your password, you could simply use a new system utility - that let you type something like \"psw <username>\" to retrieve that user password.  So you could easily retrieve your password....or that of any other user.   I've always wondered who wrote that utility - a classic \"weekend hack\".\r\n\r\nThe only \"real\" security I recall was security through obscurity, e.g., the magic incantation to write enable DDT for SYS debugging, or the \"Maze Guncher\" that looked for Maze jobs and made them commit suicide without drawing suspicion to the Guncher's existence.\r\n\r\nAnother obsecurity mechanism was an \"Al Imitator\".  Al Vezza was our group manager, i.e., the boss.  Someone created a utility that allowed you to connect to someone else's terminal and impersonate Al, using the existing ^_C mechanism.  So on your terminal suddenly \"MSG from AV:\" would pop up, and your terminal I/O was now linked (allegedly) to Al's.  The hack utility recreated Al's characteristic hunt-and-peck typing behavior, so what came out on the victim's terminal really looked like it was Al typing.  Very useful for getting people to give up disk space, or core memory, or stop running some compute-bound job, etc.  This didn't work much for the group staff members of course, but for the stream of students that came through every semester it was very effective.\r\n\r\nThere were of course mechanisms in the system code to do things like memory protection so your erranbt code didn't write into someone else's memory space.  But I don't think of those as \"security\" mechanisms.\r\n\r\n/Jack\r\n"

Stanley” or “Computer Fantasy and Simulation”).\r\n\r\nOf course \"protect\" is not the same as \"hidden\", but @eswenson1<https://github.com/eswenson1> said he was unable to see the directory without disabling the patch.\r\n\r\nI assume this patch wasn't a regular secturity feature, but rather a one-off hack to keep people's grubby hands off the Zork source code. I don't know if if it was a source or binary patch, and if a possible source patch would have been reverted later. For all I know, it could still be there lurking in a corner.\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/PDP-10/its/issues/850#issuecomment-388149589>, or mute the thread<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABnTXd9wRRf7CAsSuzzuMBiIuIWhVL6hks5txIw8gaJpZM4Tp3dA>.\r\n"

    "body": "[Hi Tim!]\n\nThe only \"protection\" I remember ever being in ITS was by security\nthrough obscurity.  In an environment where anyone with persistence or a\nbit of knowledge of appropriate magic incantations can change anything\nincluding the OS, and with physical access can modify the hardware at\nwill, it's hard to imagine what you could do to \"protect\".\n\nHiding is the only realistic strategy.  Hiding things in the file system\nwas a common trick.  Mostly it provided some protection from the stream\nof students that came through every semester, who hadn't had the time\n(yet) to become wizards.\n\nAt one point, management declared Maze to be illegal, and we staff\ndutifully deleted all copies of the file from the disk.\n\nOvernite, free disk space dropped to almost zero.  Apparently we didn't\nget all of the copies, and the remaining one(s) had been copied, and\ncopied, and squirrelled away inside the file system in a variety of\ncreative ways.\n\nIt might be in a file, but with the bits all ROTated so it no longer\nlooked like Maze. Or split into dozens of tiny files scattered across\ninnocuous directories.  Or hidden in someone's else's directory (e.g.,\none of the daemons' which no one totally understood anymore) with an\ninnocent name looking like a log or config file.  Etc. Etc.\n\nManagement relented (what else?), and Maze was legal again, but only at\ncertain hours.  That led to the creation of the Maze Guncher, also\nhidden and operating very stealthily, as an attempt to at least enforce\nthe rules a little bit. (IIRC, Dave/PDL implemented that)\n\nI don't remember the CFS hack, but it certainly sounds like something\nthat would work.\n\nAt least for a while...\n\nWhen I took the \"System Programming\" course at MIT (course 6.251) in\n1967 or so, there was a final exam, which involved writing some code to\ndo something in the OS.  The rules were simple.  You could pass by\neither a) writing the code to accomplish the task, or b) hacking the\ngrading program so that it thought you did the assigned task.\n\nEither was expressly permitted.  Hacking was a natural part of the\ncomputer curriculum.  So people knew how to do such things....\n\nFun times!\n/Jack\n\n\nOn 05/10/2018 01:03 PM, Timothy Anderson wrote:\n> Binary patch, if I’m not mistaken.\n> \n> If the directory name is CFS, and if your user name is not in the short\n> list of people with access, there’s no such directory.
