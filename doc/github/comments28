    "body": "Some progress, which you can find in very messy form on the [ats/zork branch](https://github.com/PDP-10/its/tree/ats/zork). With lots of GC debugging information removed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*:mdl\r\nMUDDLE 56 IN OPERATION.\r\nLISTENING-AT-LEVEL 1 PROCESS 1\r\n<RESTORE \"MADADV SAVE\">$\r\nThis Zork created January 1, 1980.\r\nWest of House\r\nThis is an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.\r\nThere is a small mailbox here.\r\nA rubber mat saying 'Welcome to Zork!' lies by the door.\r\n\r\n> [stub puts \"open mailbox\" into the input buffer]\r\n\r\nOpening the mailbox reveals a leaflet.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is still without the TELL assembly code; I'm using a bunch of pure-Muddle stubs based on the Confusion versions, hence the wrong date, lack of input, etc.\r\n\r\nTo answer some of the questions above:\r\n\r\n- When do the GCs run? `<GC-MON T>` makes MDL tell you, for both kinds of GC. There's also a `<BLOAT-STAT>` function which gives a variety of useful GC statistics.\r\n\r\n- Is the GC generally broken? I wrote [some tests](https://github.com/atsampson/its-tests/tree/master/muddle) for vector memory allocation which seems to behave fine. But the GC is complex enough that it's hard to test everything Zork is doing.\r\n\r\n- Disabling the compacting GC? You can do this with extra args to the `<GC>` function. It seems happier with the mark-sweep GC only... but it then just runs out of memory at approximately the same point that it crashed before. (Even if I rebuild MDL so the high segment is nearly where it's supposed to be.) So the run above is without the functions for the endgame included, which frees up enough space to get the rest of the game engine loaded. If I'm reading build.cmd correctly, some of the functions were originally precompiled to NBIN files, which I guess would have made them more compact...\r\n\r\n- The memory map is fine, going by the description in the Muddle manuals.\r\n\r\nI'm now wondering about trying to construct an NBIN file with one of the simpler assembly routines in (e.g. PSTRING). I did find a TOPS-20 ZORK.SAV in the PANDA distribution, which should include similar versions of these routines in assembled form. The manual has a good description of how registers are used in these routines, but the challenge will be figuring out how things like MQUOTE work."

    "body": "Yes, MDL's SAVE and RESTORE seem to work OK, at least from the test above -- and are much faster than loading the source files the first time. I expect there's still other stuff broken about the game that we'll find when we get input working and can play through a walkthrough. (When we eventually add this to build.tcl, playing through the first few moves automatically would be a good test for MDL!)\r\n\r\nIt would obviously save a lot of effort if the compiler (and assembler, which it depends on) can be found. I don't particularly fancy rewriting the assembler in Muddle, so I'm leaning towards some kind of MIDAS-based hack to get TELL working at the moment..."

This was not 'incestuous' since the part of the system executed by the underlying Lisp (the virtual machine, or VM) was carefully written in such a way that it in principle it did not need a garbage collector, tail recursion, or other Lisp-specific apparatus; it was really a C or assembly-level program with Lisp syntax. Scheme 48's Lispy implementation language ('LIL' was the acronym used at MIT for this kind of thing in the 1970s) was later dubbed 'Pre-Scheme'."

If you say `:xxfile /p tty:_simple xx`, then the STY emulates a printing terminal and it doesn't clear the screen on logout, etc., so that's probably more appropriate if we wanted to use it in build.tcl."

(Normally, SCRIMP sends to the PDP11 and stores there the raster for every character in all the FONTs you used.

    "body": "Yep, XGP sounds like a good bet. Going from XGP to PDF directly would probably produce the nicest output - some of the fonts used could be mapped to the standard PDF fonts, and others could be converted (which'd be a bit of work) or rendered as bitmaps.\r\n\r\nA lower-tech approach would be to modify XD (#635) or VERSA (#856) to write their rasterised output as a bitmap file, then convert to PDF from there. It'd probably look OK but not be searchable.\r\n\r\nIt looks like SAIL used a similar format for their XGP - [this description](https://www.saildart.org/j5/J17_html/XGPSER.html#XGPSER:0023) is nearly the same as [INFO;XGP](https://github.com/PDP-10/its-vault/blob/master/files/info/xgp.24#L341)."

    "body": "Having dug into the (elegant and well-documented) code for this a bit... when invoked as VERSA, it goes into a test mode where it loads a fixed series of files and displays them using SUPDUP graphics.\r\n\r\nIf you invoke it with a different name (perhaps SPOOLR), it operates as MC's general-purpose printer spooler, reading files from .GLPR.; in various formats, rasterising them into a large array, and feeding them to various output devices (e.g. Gould and Versatec printers). One of the output devices is \"hargld\", which writes 200DPI run-length-encoded bitmap files to .TEMP.;, and it looks like it'd be straightforward to convert those to a modern format, or add a similar backend to write a different format.\r\n\r\nThe .GLPR. directory came from the Gould spooler, which is documented in INFO; GLP >. AI: SYSENG; XQUEUE > is the program to add files to the queue.\r\n\r\nOn the downside, XGP input support is commented out, and ITS OBUGS0 includes a 1982 post from DCP which says:\r\n\r\n> In theory (if I turned on XGP file recognition in the spooler), XGP files produced by R come out correctly, but XGP files produced by TJ6 or BOLIO (and I think @) cause it to crash."

    "body": "Yes, I remember Dazzle Dart. It was a great game, I'd love to play it again.\r\n\r\nI believe there was only ever a single instance of Dazzle Dart, running on unique hardware -- set up only in the Logo Lab at 545 Tech Square. And I don't believe it remained set up for that long. I believe I only got to play Dazzle Dart a handful of times.\r\n\r\nIt definitely did not run on the AI Lab PDP6 (which was that only one MIT had in the 1970s).\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure at least a portion of Dazzle Dart ran on a PDP11 (and the file names in the HAL directory above would seem to confirm that). However, I think there's a good possibility that the other portion ran on the Logo3400 -- a 16 bit minicomputer that Marvin Minsky (and Seymour Papert?) designed for running Logo. I believe the 3400 was attached to a unique display -- possibly the \"Minsky Display\" mentioned in AI memo 356 mentioned above. (I'm a little surprised that the memo doesn't mention the Logo 3400 -- and in fact, Google can't seem to find any reference to the Logo 3400, so my memory of these things 40+ years ago might not be that precise..).\r\n\r\nAre those files in the HAL: directory accessible somewhere? I could likely give you better information if I could examine them.\r\n\r\nHal Abelson would certainly know more. Danny Hillis might know more about the hardware setup, as he took a job programming the Logo 3400. (A job I foolishly turned down)."

It'll take a while to fully digest this.\r\n\r\nHere's more about the PDP6 version, if there ever was one.  \"AMF arm pots\" sounds a lot like AI lab!\r\n> the problem is getting enough input controls for 4 players.  For the 6 we tried to use the bank of AMF arm pots, and actually had enough bits altogether, but some pots were broken, others were non-linear, and the whole thing was just too clumsy to be any fun.\r\n\r\nThe files aren't available now.
