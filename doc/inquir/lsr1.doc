This file describes the format of the new LSR1 user data base.
Note that a standard library, SYSENG;LSRTNS >, exists for
referencing this data base.  Use it!

The file header:

HDRSID==0	; wd 0	SIXBIT /LSR1!!/
HDRDAT==1	; wd 1	Date of compilation as sixbit YYMMDD
HDRTIM==2	; wd 2	Time of compilation as sixbit HHMMSS
HDRUNM==3	; wd 3	Address in file of UNAME table.
HDRLNM==4	; wd 4	Address in file LASTNAME table.
HDRDAT==5	; wd 5  Address in file of start of data area.
		;	The data area must start on a page boundary,
		;	and it must be the last thing in the file.
		;....

The UNAME table:

    wd 0	Number of entries in this table,
		followed by entries, one per page of data area,
		each containing the UNAME of the first data area
		entry which begins on that page.

The LASTNAME table:

    wd 0	Number of entries in this table,
		followed by entries, in order by last name
    Each entry looks like this:
      rh	addr in file of entry
      lh	addr in file of Last-name string

  The lastname strings are word-aligned upper-case ASCIZ strings,
  and they follow the LASTNAME table.

The data area:

  It starts on a page boundary.  It is made up of consecutive entries,
  in order by UNAME, each looking like this:

LDACNT==0	;   entry wd 0  lh
		;     the number of words in the entry,
		;     including this one.
		;   entry wd 0  rh  -1

  followed by unaligned ASCIZ strings, one per item, separated
  only by the single ^@ that ends the ASCIZ.  The strings are associated
  with their meanings according to their numerical position in the entry.
  The entire entry is then padded to a word boundary with nulls.
  Note that the low bit is set in the count-words of entries
  and not in any other words of the data area.

  The entries are sorted in ascii order, which is NOT the same
  as the order obtained by arithmetically sorting the SIXBIT unames.

  The end of the data area is marked by ,,-1, which
  is tantamount to an entry 0 words long.
  That word is also the last word of the file.

The standard symbols for all the items are these:

I$==,-1
I$UNAM==0	;UNAME
I$NAME==1	;FULL NAME
I$NICK==2	;NICKNAME
I$SSN==3	;SOC SEC #. 
I$MITA==4	;MIT ADDRESS
I$MITT==5	;MIT TELEPHONE NUMBER
I$HOMA==6	;HOME ADDRESS
I$HOMT==7	;HOME TELEPHONE NUMBER
I$SUPR==10	;SUPERVISOR(S)
I$PROJ==11	;PROJECT
I$DIR==12	;FILE DIR NAMES
I$AUTH==13	;AUTHORIZATION
I$GRP==14	;GROUP AFFILIATION
I$REL==15	;RELATION TO GROUP
I$BRTH==16	;BIRTHDAY
I$REM==17	;REMARKS
I$NETA==20	;NETWORK ADDRESS
I$ALTR==21	;USER &TIME OF LAST ALTERATION
I$MACH==22	;I.T.S.'S TO BE KNOWN ON.
