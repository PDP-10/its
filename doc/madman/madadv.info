Welcome to Zork!

    You are near a large underground labyrinth, which is reputed to
contain vast quantities of treasure.  Naturally, you wish to acquire
some of it. In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the
caverns; to receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in
the trophy case in the living room.
    
    In addition to valuables, the cave contains various objects which
may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich; you may need
sources of light, since caves are often dark, and weapons, since
dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading material
is scattered around as well; some of it is rumoured to be useful.

    To determine how successful you have been, there is a score kept.
When you find a valuable object (i.e., pick it up), you receive a
certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding
it.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure safely to
the living room, and placing it in the trophy case.  In addition,
some particularly interesting rooms  have a value associated with
your entering them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,
which you may do only twice.

    Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who likes
to wander around underground (he has never been seen by the light of
day).  He likes to take things; since he steals for pleasure rather than
profit, and is sadistic, he only takes things which you have seen.
Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste he may take
something which is worthless; from time to time, he examines his take
and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occasionally stop in
a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders through and rips
you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).

    Have Fun!
