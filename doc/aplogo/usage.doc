CLEARINPUT					Input
	Clears the input character buffer. Useful for programs which use
	real-time keyboard input.

	Clears the graphics screen, homes and shows the turtle. Inititates
	graphics mode if necessary (mixed text/graphics).

NOT			{boolean}		Boolean
NUMBER?			{word/list}		Boolean
OUTPUT		OP	{word/list}		Control
PAUSE						Control
	Stops execution and allows input to be evaluated. Equivalent to interrupt
	character Control-Z. Execution is resumed with CONTINUE, provided no errors
	have occured.
PENDOWN		PD				Graphics
PENUP		PU				Graphics
POTS						Workspace
PRINT		PR	Variable number of {word/list}'s - 1 default   Output
PRINT1			Variable number of {word/list}'s - 1 default   Output
	Like PRINT, but does not terminate the output line.
PRINTOUT	PO				Workspace
PROCEDURES					Quantifier
PRODUCT			{number} {number}	Arithmetic
QUOTIENT		{number} {number}	Arithmetic
RANDOM						Arithmetic
	Returns a random number 0-9. Identical seeds will give repeatable
	sequences of random numbers. See RANDOMIZE.
RANDOMIZE					Arithmetic
	Randomizes the seed for RANDOM. The seed can also be initialized
	in certain cases by depositing into the RNDL and RNDH memory locations.
READ			{word}			Filing
	Reads a file from disk. See the Filing comments. Destroys any graphics
	display.
READCHARACTER	RC				Input
	Outputs the least recent character in the character buffer, or if empty,
	waits for an input character.
REPEAT			{number} {list}		Control
REQUEST		RQ				Input
RETRIEVE					Screen Editor
	Re-enters the editor with the previous buffer's contents if they are still
	retrievable (i.e., no graphics or filing has been done since the last
	screen editor session, provided there was a previous one). Useful if
	an error occurred while the contents of the edit buffer were being evaluated.

RUN			{list}			Control
SAVE			{word}			Filing
	Saves the contents of the workspace on disk. See the Filing comments. Destroys

	Sets the turtle according to a variable-length list of elements. First
	element is XCOR, then YCOR, then HEADING, then "TRUE or "FALSE for
	show or hide turtle, then "TRUE or "FALSE for pen down or pen up.
	Complementary to TURTLESTATE.

	Returns a list of five elements. First is XCOR, then YCOR, then HEADING,
	then "TRUE or "FALSE for shown or hidden turtle, then "TRUE or "FALSE for
	pen down or pen up. Complementary to SETTURTLE.

.BPT						System
	Breaks out of LOGO into the LOGO monitor. See the LOGO Monitor comments.
	Control-B breaks from LOGO monitor into ROM Monitor, and then another
	Control-B will enter BASIC. The RESET key should be pressed upon entering
	BASIC after using LOGO, to reinitialize certain BASIC parameters.
.CALL			{number}		System
	Calls a machine language subroutine anyplace in memory, which is expected
	to do an RTS or a JMP to the POPJ label.
.DEPOSIT		{number} {number}	System
	Deposits byte of data at a memory location.
.EXAMINE		{number}		System
	Returns the value of the byte at the specified address.

Interrupt characters:

Control-G	Stops execution and returns control to toplevel.
Control-Z	Stops execution and allows input to be evaluated (see PAUSE).
Control-S	Stops screen output - typing any character will resume output.
Control-F	In graphics mode, displays a full screen of graphics (see FULL).
Control-L	In graphics mode, displays a mixed text/graphics screen (see MIX).
