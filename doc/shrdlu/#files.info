The files in trhis directory contain the following
code and information

.lisp. (init) - allocation comments and loader functions
for making SHRDLU's from scratch

blocks >   microplanner code for the blocks world with the
supporting LISP functions

data >   initial contents of the blocks world's microplanner
database

debug >    ideosyncratic functions created by SHRDLU's
various maintainers for grovelling arround in its guts and hacking its
display routines. Guarented illegible to ordinary mortals

demo flick     the guts of ts twdemo

dictio >   specifications and entries for SHRDLU's vocabulary and
markers list. Contains all aspects of the definitions: syntactic,
semantic, macro-expanders etc.

displa info   a brief description of the usage of the model
maintained for the DEC340 scope

ginter >    "grammar interpreter" ; called the first time any grammar
routine is used when running interpretive code.

gramar >   - linked to gramar > dsk gramar. Entire syntactic recognition
grammar for SHRDLU. See also A.I. memo 282 "Grammar for the
People"  for flowcharts of it.

grind (init)  - special instructions to grind to have
shrdlu's functions come out in their prefered format

manual >    user's guide to SHRDLU  - everything one needs
to know to put it through its paces

moby dump   an ancient vintage core dump used for occasional
demos. Its only redeming feature is that it can execute the 
entire dialog with teh attendant capabilities for
accepting new definitions, following building plans, etc.
-partially compiled and completely unintelligible internally.

newans >    (new-answer) code for finding the answers to questions, absorbing
new information, and following commands; then formulating appropriate
answers. Extensively interfaced with microplanner.

print macro   a teco macro for generating listings of all of
SHRDLU. This same effect can be gained by invoking
a teco from the "lang" directory

setup >  loose ends file for initializing global variabels,
clobering the errlist, etc.  - intended to be the
last file readin when constructing a shrdlu.

show >  functions for the show/tell displaying routines
-see the user's guide

shrdlu >  core image dunp of the most current, best debugged SHRDLU.
linked to by sys;ts shrdlu

smass >   access functions that are used by the
semantics routines to crawl through
their data structures

smspec >    semantic specialist functions  which do the heavy work
of the semantics component

smutil >  utility functions utilized by teh semantics routines
for globbling definitions, creating planner code, checking marker
lists, etc.

syscom >  contains the toplevel functions "SHRDLU" and "ETAOIN"
as well as system-wide utility functions for printing,
breaking, etc.

ts twdemo   a canned version of the blocks dialog using the
340 display

xcomp >   declarations for the LAP compiler

z ...   files used by the original implementation of
SHRDLU (there are known bugs in the grammar)
