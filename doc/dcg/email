These files are some scribbles I did when I was reverse-engineering
ITS and designing my version of the pager that only did what ITS ended
up needing.

The text in PAG-NOTES that begins with "THE KA IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE
THIS" is actually describing the block that holds the paging
context (it's described in ITS as 8 variables that need to be together
and in the right order, not as a BLOCK 10 and some offsets).
