<strong>PDP-6 LISP</strong>
</p>

<p>
ITS has a copy of PDP-6 LISP, found on a DECtape from Peter Samson.  It&#039;s located in the <code>.</code> directory.  To run it, the computer must be taken out of timesharing.  From DSKDMP, just type <code>lisp</code> to start PDP-6 LISP.  It has been patched to run on a PDP-10 as well.

Here is a sample session which displays <code>HELLO-WORLD</code> on the 340 display.

<pre class="code">    ALLOC? N
    
    (ARRAY HELLO T 100)
    36233
    (DISINI (QUOTE HELLO))
    NIL
    (SETQ DISLIST (LIST (GET (QUOTE HELLO) (QUOTE SUBR))))
    (#36171)
    (DIDAS (QUOTE HELLO) NIL (QUOTE HELLO-WORLD))
    T</pre>
