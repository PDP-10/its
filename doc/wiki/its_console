<strong>ITS console panel functions</strong>

<p>
If you are lucky to run ITS on a
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> real KA10,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> PiDP-10,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> KL10 with KL-UDGE board, or</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> emulator with Panda Display board</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You will have some lights and switches.  In addition to the normal functions, ITS has some more:
</p>

<p>
The memory indicator lights show which job is running.  This can be disabled by setting MIPGDS to -1.  To control the lights from a user program, use .IOTLSR to enable IOT user mode and write to the lights register with DATAO PI,AC.
</p>

<p>
Data switch 0 will make ITS go to NTS DDT.  This is very useful to set breakpoints etc, for debugging ITS.  Switches can be read from a user program with DATAI APR,AC.
</p>

<p>
On the PDP-6, the memory indicator lights are connected to speakers.
