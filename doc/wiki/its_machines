<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The AI lab PDP-6 arrived in 1964.  It never had a name per se.  It was first used standalone, but a need for timesharing resulted in ITS running in July 1967.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Next came the AI lab PDP-10 with a KA10 processor.  It was named AI when ITS moved to more machines.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The Dynamic Modeling group received a pre-owned PDP-6 in 1969.  It was never used much.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The DM KA10 arrived in 1970.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The Mathlab KA10 was delivered in 1971 and became operational during 1972.  It was named ML.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The Macsyma Consortium KL10 arrived in 1975 and was named MC.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> In the late 1970s, the two PDP-6 machines fell into disrepair.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> In the early 1980s, the three KA10 machines were shut down.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Four new KS10 machines were donated by DEC in the mid 1980s and ITS was ported.  They took the names AI, ML, MD, and MX.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> MX and MC swapped names, and the KL10 was shipped to Sweden in 1988.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The last KS10 machines were shut down in 1990, with AI briefly making a reappearence in 1991 to send a farewell message to SAIL.</div>
