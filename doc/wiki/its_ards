ARDS, or Advanced Remote Display System, was ground breaking storage CRT display terminal technology developed at MIT in the 1960s.  A company called Computer Displays Inc. was spun off to commercialize the technology.  The terminals were mostly used with CTSS, but the AI lab <a href="/doku.php?id=programming_the_pdp-6" class="wikilink1" title="programming_the_pdp-6">PDP-6</a> also had a few.

<a href="/doku.php?id=its_topics" class="wikilink1" title="its_topics">ITS</a> retains some traces of ARDS support.  The terminal type was removed in 1976 and replaced by Tektronix.  There is a program called ARDPRN for displaying graphics files on a capable display such as <a href="/doku.php?id=its_imlac" class="wikilink1" title="its_imlac">Imlacs</a>.  The BIG music program can draw scores in ARDS format.
