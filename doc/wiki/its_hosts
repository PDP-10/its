<div class="level4">

<p>
ITS was used mostly in the era before <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr>, when a hosts.txt file was regularly distributed to all Arpanet hosts.  If you want to add a new host and its IP number, you have to update ITS&#039; host table.
</p>

<p>
ITS&#039; human readable host table is in the file <code>SYSHST; H3TEXT &gt;</code>.  You update it with a regular text editor.  To add a new host, enter a line like <code>HOST : A.B.C.D : NAME : MACHINE : <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> : :</code>.  A.B.C.D is the IP number, and NAME is the hostname.  MACHINE and <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> are free text descriptions.
</p>

<p>
Having done this, you have to update the binary host table <code>SYSBIN; HOSTS3 &gt;</code> which is what programs actually use to look up host names.  To update this from the text file, just run <code>:SYSHST;H3MAKE</code>.
