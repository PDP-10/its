To patch ITS while it&#039;s running, first type <code>sys$j</code> to get the sysjob.  This job has the core image of the ITS monitor, but it&#039;s write-protected by default.  To unprotect it, type <code>$$^R</code>.

<p>
To get a directory listing, type <code>^R m.f.d. (file)</code>.  Or run PEEK on the 340 display (type <code>^Y</code>) and type <code>D</code>.
</p>

<p>
To make a new directory, say foobar, type <code>^R foobar; ..new. (udir)</code>.  Unless on a really old ITSâ€¦ in which case you must patch the ITS location NUFDTB with the sixbit name of the directory, and then access a file in it.
