<strong>ITS and the Logo programming language</strong>
</p>

<p>
ITS was host to a lot of Logo development.  There are many implementations available:

<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> BBN Logo for the PDP-10</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> MIT PDP-10 Logo developed from BBN Logo</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> PDP-11 Logo</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Lisp Logo</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> General Turtle, is not available yet</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Apple II Logo</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
PDP-11 Logo was the reference implementation.  It ran on a PDP-11/45 with special display hardware added.  There were older vector displays by Tom Knight, and newer raster displays by Ron Lebel (mostly same as the Knight TV hardware).

<p>
At first PDP-11 Logo ran on the metal, but later a timesharing system was developed.  It was called SITS, or Small ITS.  The initial design was similar to ITS, but later development took inspiration from MIT&#039;s PDP-1X timesharing system.

<p>
A minimal Little SITS emulator was used to run PDP-11 Logo on the General Turtle LSI-11 processor.

Hal Abelson et al wrote an interesting game using the vector displays, called Dazzle Dart.  Two teams of two plays against each other, and the objective is to shine a ray of light in the opposing team&#039;s goal.  The ray must reflect at least once for a goal to be scored, making it possibly the first game with ray tracing.
