COMMANDS TAKE PRECEDING NUMERIC ARGUMENTS
EXAMPLE: 1+F ADDS 1 TO THE CURRENT VALUE, AND FACTORS IT

‰RUBOUT IGNORES ITS ARGUMENT
Q	FOLLOWED BY COMMAND, DESCRIBES COMMAND
?	TYPES THIS FILE

=	IGNORES ARG, TYPES CURRENT VALUE
R	SETS INPUT RADIX TO ARG (MOD 2^35)
D	SETS INPUT RADIX TO DECIMAL (IGNORES ARG)
N	MOVES CURRENT VALUE INTO ARG SPACE; THUS N3 APPENDS A 3
	TO THE CURRENT VALUE
F	FACTORS ARG IF NOT ZERO; STORES INTO CURRENT VALUE
