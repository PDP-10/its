BANNER INFO					PDL 3/26/76
				Last update:	SWG 12/30/77

	BANNER is a program for making banners on line-printer paper
in various XGP fonts.  It is invoked by:

:BANNER <switches> <output file> (filler) "message" <font0>,<font1>,...

where:

<switches>
	Can be any one of:

	| --  Print vertically

	- --  Print horizontally (default)

	^<char> -- (uparrow followed by a char)
		Specifies that <char> be used as the
		"linefeed" character.  This allows certain
		line printers to avoid page perforation gaps.
		In particular:

		^K -- (uparrow-K, not ^K):  use VT for line-feed.
		      This is the default, and the DM unspooler has
		      been hacked to recognize this as a non-line
		      counting line-feed, i.e., you won't get gaps
		      at page perforations.

		^S -- (uparrow-S, not ^S): the Tenex and Twenex
			line printer routines treat this as DM
			does for ^K.

		^J -- (uparrow-J, not ^J): use LF for line-feed.
			Necessary for terminals.

<output file>
	Is where to put the banner file.  It is optional and defaults
	to "<msname>;_BANNE >".

(filler)
	is the string of characters to be used over and over to form
	the letters on the banner.  It is bounded by the (), which
	MUST be included.  To include a ) in the filler, use )) or \),
	as for "s in the message (below).  If you want the standard
	filler (*), leave out parentheses and all in the invocation.

"message"
	Is the message you want on the banner.  It is bounded by the
	"'s, which MUST be included.  To imbed a " in the message,
	use two in a row or precede it with a reverse slash (\),
	depending on whether you are a PL/I or MUDDLE hacker.
	Reverse slash followed by a character other than double quote
	indicates a "function character" rather than an ordinary
	character in the message.  The following is the only function
	character yet defined:
		\L -- put a control-L (FF) in the output at this point.
	Font 0 is initially used; to select a different font within
	the message, use a control-F followed by the number of the
	font to switch to.

<font0>,<font1>...
	Are the fonts to print the banner in.  The first one specified is
	font 0, the next is font 1, etc. up to font 9 (for a maximum
	of 10 fonts).  If none are specified, the default font 0 is
	"DSK:FONTS;40VSHD KST".  For setup purposes, it is best if
	the largest font is specified first, as font 0.

	The resulting banner file can be printed on a MEMOWRECK or on
an ODEC LPT by incanting ":COPY file,Tnm:" where Tnm is the appropriate
console number.
	If you are on DM, you can spool your banner in the usual way,
as the UNSPOOler now can "image" a file -- no gaps at page perforations!

Examples:

:BANNER XMAS > "Merry Christmas" 37VXMS
	; create the traditional xmas banner.

:BANNER XMAS > (HUMBUG! ) "Merry Christmas" 37VXMS
	; a variation on the above (note space in filler)

:BANNER "MUDDLE FOREVER!"
	; create the banner in room 214.

:BANNER ^S GUEST;FOO > "1Tenex? 0BLETCH2!!!" 40VRI,30VR,40VSHD
	; create a file for a T(w)enex LPT (with ^S's instead of ^J's)
	; using 3 different fonts.

Notes:

1.  Characters given which are not in the current font will halt
    the program.  This is checked before any actual output is begun.

2.  The font given is expanded with some effort (not 100% successful)
    made to get a reasonable aspect ratio out.  For fonts of less than
    40 in height this works out to about an expansion of 3 vertical
    and two horizontal.  This expansion calculation is made on the
    basis of font 0's size, which is why the largest font should be
    font 0.  Otherwise the largest font might exceed the paper width.
