TN6 IS FOR COMMUNICATING OVER THE NET
WITH LINE AT A TIME SYSTEMS SUCH AS MULTICS.
IT IS LIKE TELNET, WITH THE FOLLOWING CHANGES:

INPUT IS NOT SENT TO THE FOREIGN HOST UNTIL YOU HIT RETURN.
LINEFEED SENDS THE INPUT OFF WITHOUT A NEW-LINE SEQUENCE AT THE
END.
RUBOUT IS DONE LOCALLY, AND ON DISPLAY TERMINALS THE LINE IMAGE
IS CORRECTLY MAINTAINED.
CONTROL/V RETYPES THE LINE IN CASE YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT YOU'VE
RUBBED OUT.
^P ERASES THE SCREEN. (ON A DATAPOINT, USE CONTROL/ZERO.)
^K KILLS THE CURRENT LINE.
^U AND ^L ARE USED FOR CASE SHIFTING INSTEAD OF \.
HITTING SHIFT/RETURN ON A DATAPOINT WILL DO WHAT YOU MEANT.
WHEN YOU ARE USING A DISPLAY TERMINAL AND THE FOREIGN HOST OUTPUTS
A FORM FEED OR RUNS OFF THE SCREEN,
TN6 WILL SAY "--MORE--".  VALID RESPONSES ARE P (NEW PAGE),
T (GO TO TOP OF SCREEN WITHOUT ERASING), OR S (SCROLL -- WON'T
WORK UNTIL ITS SUPPORTS ^P>.)

THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS ARE AVAILABLE.  TO ENTER A COMMAND
HIT CTRL/UP-ARROW AND ENTER A COMMAND LINE (ECHOS AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.)  HIT CTRL/K TO LEAVE COMMAND MODE
WITHOUT TYPING A COMMAND.  IN COMMAND MODE, HIT QUESTION
MARK FOR HELP.
COMMANDS MARKED WITH AN ASTERISK REQUIRE AN ARGUMENT
WHICH HAS TO BE EITHER THE WORD ON OR THE WORD OFF.

THE NAME OF THE HOST TO BE ATTACHED TO MAY BE ENTERED EITHER
ON THE JOB-COMMAND-LINE OR IN RESPONSE TO "HOST="
YOU MAY GIVE A HOST NUMBER OR A HOST NAME.  NUMBERS ARE IN
OCTAL UNLESS FOLLOWED BY A DECIMAL POINT, WHICH MAKES THEM
DECIMAL.  TO CONNECT TO A FUNNY SOCKET ENTER THE SOCKET
NUMBER, A COMMA, AND THE HOST NAME OR NUMBER.
TO CONNECT TO A TIP PORT ENTER THE PORT NUMBER, A SEMICOLON,
AND THE TIP NAME OR NUMBER.
   IF YOU GIVE AN EXCLAMATION POINT TN6 WILL KEEP TRYING
TO GET THROUGH, IF THE HOST IS DEAD OR NOT ANSWERING.
   WHEN ENTERING A HOST NAME, TN6 WILL FEEP AT YOU IF
YOU ENTER A CHARACTER WHICH DOESN'T MATCH.  SPACE COMPLETES
THE NAME OR FEEPS IF IT IS AMBIGUOUS.  QUESTION MARK OR
ALTMODE LISTS ALL POSSIBLE COMPLETIONS.  IF GIVEN INITIALLY,
ALL THE HOSTS IN THE WORLD ARE LISTED.
   COMPLETE THE HOST NAME WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN.
   RUBOUT GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO START OVER IF YOU ERR.

   THE TIP ON COMMAND ALLOWS YOU TO SLAVE A TIP PORT
TO YOUR CONSOLE.  THE COMMAND ASKS FOR THE TIP NAME
AND PORT NUMBER.  THE SLAVED TIP PORT WILL TYPE OUT
A SCRIPT OF ALL I/O.  YOU CAN USE A SILENT COMMAND
TO SHUT OFF TYPING ON YOUR OWN CONSOLE.
INPUT FROM THE TIP IS NOT ACCEPTED.
TYPE TIP OFF TO FLUSH THIS.  NOTE:  OUTPUT IS SENT TO
THE TIP JUST AS IT IS RECEIVED FROM FOREIGN HOST.
NO PROCESSING OF TABS, ETC. IS DONE.
IF YOU GET AN IOC. ERROR WHEN YOU GIVE THIS COMMAND,
TYPE P AND YOU WILL THEN WIN.  SOMEDAY I WILL FIX THIS BUG.
