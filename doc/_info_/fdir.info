There is a new way to list directories on the system called "FDIR".
Output is similiar to the D device, but it is neater and is more convenient
to use.

To use it, type:  FDIR <cr>
	     or:  FDIR  <directory><cr>
	     or:  FDIR  <dev>:<directory><cr>
		etc.

Archives, other ITS hosts etc. will work when explicitly specified.   If no
directory is given, the current defaults will be used.  If the directory is
on disk,a "dskuse %" will be done.   The advantage of this program over the
D deviceis that the defaults are not changed (you have to change it back to
DSK to read from it otherwise).
