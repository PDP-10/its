TRACE 46 is the new version of trace.
To use the old version, (FASLOAD OTRACE FASL DSK COMLAP).

Features:

[1]	Unlike previous versions of Trace, this one is
	fully compiled.  Thus it will load noticeably faster,
	and the faster execution of the function TRACE may
	be noticeable when the system is heavily loaded
	(which is often, nowadays).

[2]	The stuff printed by Trace is indented according to
	the actual depth of function nesting (not to be
	confused with the number that Trace prints in the
	(ENTER FOO <number>  ...) message, which is the
	recursion level for that____ function only).
	The variable TRACE-INDENT-INCR (initially = 2)
	controls the number of spaces indented for each
	level deep.
	TRACE-INDENT-MAX (initially = 16) limits the
	total indentation to that many spaces.
	To disable the indenting feature, set either of
	these variables to zero.

[3]	The GRIND option as described in the Maclisp manual
	exists here (there no longer being any STRACE).
	The hack mentioned in the update to the manual about
	setting the variable SPRINTER to T is now inoperative.
	So (TRACE (FOO GRIND)) will cause the trace messages
	to be pretty-printed  (Note, however, that they will
	not___ be indented as in [2]).

[4]	Several minor bugs dealing with some of the more
	obscure options have been fixed.
	For example, the sequence:
	 (TRACE FOO)
	 (TRACE (BAR WHEREIN FOO))
	now works properly.
	Also, ARGPDL now works with LSUBRs (as if anyone cares).

	Please send comments regarding any remaining bugs
	to GROSS at MIT-AI.
