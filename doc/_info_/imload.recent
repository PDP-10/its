Version 45__________		1/13/74

Changes to command parser to bring DDT command line and typed in
command line parsing into agreement:  For example,

			:IMLOAD <sp> <cr>

no longer causes the default load -- it just goes to the reader.
In general, leading spaces, tabs, and such are ignored, and if
there are no interesting characters in the DDT command line, the
reader is entered.

Version_______ 44__		11/20/74

You can now IMLOAD SRI-ARC format files (such as IMNLS) directly.
Also, second file name of input now defaults to "IML".  Finally,
IMLOAD now does rubout deleting, ^L clears screen and retypes input,
and ^Q quits.  The prompt character is now "@" to end confusion with
DDT's prompt.

Version_______ 43__		9/3/74

Messages now are all lower case so that TIPs don't lose during "5
second" wait.
Version_______ 42__		7/2/74

You can now have a file on your directory called either .PRGM. Tnm or
.PRGM. NORMAL, and it will be used before the normal files on IMLAC;
when you default loading (by typing just a TTY number or .).

Version_______ 41__		5/9/74

?? (Minor default hacking bugs?)

Version 40_______ __		2/18/74

Bugs in IMTRAN defaults fixed.

Version 39_______ __		2/16/74

It is now not necessary to specify the "_" to load a program other than
the standard console program into your console.  That is, type:

		:IMLOAD FOO BAR

rather than

		:IMLOAD _FOO BAR

Version 38_______ __		2/13/74

Changes to IMTRAN in this version.  It is now possible to IMLOAD DDT
dump files and STINK dump files.  That is, if you have a BIN version
of an IMLAC program you can $L it in DDT, make patches, $Y it and
still be able to IMLOAD it afterwards.

Version 37_______ __

??

Version_______ 36__		1/31/74

The normal console program is now "IMLAC;.PRGM. NORMAL", which should
be a link to the appropriate program.  If the .OPEN to ".PRGM. Tnm"
fails, meaning the IMLAC is not to be loaded specially, then it tries
the default: ".PRGM. NORMAL".  Only if that also fails does it say
"INPUT OPEN FAILED".

Version_______ 35__		1/25/74

Minor bug fixed which concerns action to be taken when program is
apparently not normal format.  Concerns BBN IMLAC mostly.

Version_______ 34__		1/8/74

IMLOAD now refuses communication during loading (that is, communication
directed at the console being loaded).  The pre-IMLOAD communicate
state is restored when IMLOAD kills itself.

Version_______ 33__		12/5/73

(a) IMLOAD now takes its argument optionally on the command line.
That is:

	;IMLOAD 25<cr>

will load T25.  A new special argument has been added:

	;IMLOAD .<cr>

will reload TTY (like typing <cr> only to IMLOAD's prompt char.
If no argument is given on the command line, IMLOAD works just
as it used to.

(b) The standard default program for graphics IMLACs is now
GSV IML, which has ARDS style graphics in it.  It is "SSV.9" in the
upper left of the screen.

Version_______ 32__		11/10/73

The new version of IMLOAD knows about the "standard" program
for each IMLAC.  Graphics IMLACs are NSV, and alphanumeric
IMLACs are SSV.  To get the standard program loaded into a machine
type (to IMLOAD):

<cr-lf>		; to reload TTY

or

<console number><crlf>	; to reload console "T<console number>"
