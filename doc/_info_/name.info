	'NAME' is a status program which will give you more
detailed information about users than that available from
'WHO' or 'PEEK'-- primarily, the full names of the users it
knows about and the physical location of their terminal.
Typing just "NAME^K" or ":NAME<cr>" causes all users on the
system to be described. To see what such a printout looks like,
just look at any free TV console. Typing ":NAME <uname><cr>" causes
the user whose uname is specified to be described, whether he is
currently logged in or not. Typing ":NAME <head><cr>" where
<head> is a few letters will cause all users whose last names
start with those few letters to be described, whether they are
currently logged in or not. There is no ambiguity between the
last two schemas, because the argument, if any, is treated both
as a uname and as a head - if it is someone's uname, that person
will be described, and if it is an initial segment of someone's
last name, that person will be described.

Before the last names of some users there may appear single
upper-case letters. Their significance is as follows:

A	Alias for A.I. Person.
C	Project M.A.C. Visitor.
D	Dynamic Modelling Visitor.
H	Actor or Planner Person.
L	LOGO Person.
M	Mathlab Visitor.
O	Other (XGP, MINI, TJ6, VIS, CNVR) Programs.
T	Tourist/Guest (Semi-authorized person outside the lab)
U	Unauthorized.
X	eX-user	- May be asked to log-out.

When the system is loaded, the first to go fall in categories
U and X and T. After that, start complaining that the
machine/human ratio of the A. I. Lab is too low.

To see only users logged in who are listed in some specific
category, type ":NAME <altmode><prefix><cr>". Thus, ":NAME X"
will display information about the ex-users logged on to the
system.

The NAME program was written by Ken Harrenstien, and updated
by Stan Kugell and R. Stallman. Send comments via :BUG NAME ... ^C
