                                        or, T_h_e_ _N_e_w_ _R_e_g_i_m_e_

            There are important new changes to the text justifier.  These changes are
            incorporated in NNTJ6.  After a while, NNTJ6 will become the standard TJ6,
            so use NNTJ6 and help get the bugs out.

            Most of these changes are designed to straighten out the mess which is the
            insides of TJ6. Changes visible to the user are:

            NNTJ6 is half p_u_r_e_ _c_o_d_e_.  Hopefully this will speed it up in certain
            circumstances.

            It has some n_e_w_ _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s_:
            ._P_W_I_N_C_H_ _n_ -- sets paper width (.PAPERW) in tenths of an inch.  E.G., 
                     .PWINCH 8.5 sets the physical paper width to 8.5 inches.
            ._T_W_I_N_C_H_ _n_ -- sets text width (.LINE) 
            ._P_L_I_N_C_H_ _n_ -- paper length (.PSIZE) 
            ._T_L_I_N_C_H_ _n_ -- text length (.PAPER) 
            ._S_I_N_C_H_ _a_,_b_,_c_,_d_,_e_ -- sets paper width, text width, paper length, text
                    length, and left margin  in inches respectively to a,b,c,d, and e.
                    E.G., 
                     .SINCH 8.5,6.,11,8.0,1.5 sets the physical paper size to 8 1/2x11,
                    the text size to 6x8, and left margin to 1 1/2 inches.

            ._F_I_N_C_H_ _n_ -- sets figure size in inches.
                     ._F_I_G_U_R_E_ _n_ nows treats its argument as an absolute number of lines
                    (irregardless of whether you are single or double spacing).

            ._F_O_N_T_ _n_ _F_i_l_e_ _N_a_m_e_ -- associates font n with the appropriate font file.
                    This is used to set font height and width, for use by various size
                    commands, and to set the font name for the XGPLPT command page.
                     .FONT 1 LGI makes font 1 FONTS;LGI KST.
                    (This command actually causes the entire font to be read in and
                    groveled over, so it takes a while to execute.  The only legal
                    device names are AI and DSK.) 

            ._V_S_P_ -- sets interline space. Units are XGP raster dots, 1/192nds of an
                    inch.  (Default is 6.) 

            ._H_V_W_ _a_,_b_,_c_ -- sets the height of font 0, VSP, and width of a space in font
                    0 respectively to a, b, and c.  The defaults are 25, 6, and 16 for
                    the XGP, and 24, 6, and 19 for non-XGP.  These data are used by the
                    commands which set size in inches.  .HVW is a quicker way of
                    reading in this information than .FONT.

            X_G_P_L_P_T_ _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_ _p_a_g_e_ -- If TJ6 thinks it's outputting to the XGP, (i.e.,
                    output device is DSK: and there was either a /X in the command line
                    or a .XGP command,) it automatically outputs a page of XGPLPT
                    commands:

                    To prevent TJ6 from doing this, use:
            ._N_O_S_P_E_C_ -- turns off automatic output of XGPLPT commands.

            ._U_L_F_O_N_T_ _n_ -- causes printing in font n to be underlined if output is not to
                    the XGP.  Default is .ULFONT 1.  (This is helpful if the ulfont is
                    italicized.)  (To turn off, make n <0 or >3.) 

            _ _(_c_o_n_t_r_o_l_ _Y_)_ -- in text command character which begins underscore.
            _ _(_c_o_n_t_r_o_l_ _X_)_ -- in text command character which ends underscore.
            Note that underscoring is treated differently by TJ6 and the XGP than
                    backspacing and overstriking with underbars.  For underscoring, TJ6
                    outputs special XGP underscore commands.  For overstriking, TJ6
                    backspaces and overstrikes.  (Complicated, huh?) For most fonts,
                    the _ character is defined to look like underscoring.  For a couple
                    it isn't.  So if you mean underscore, do it, and if you mean
                    overstruck _, do that.  (Backspacing and overstriking of all
                    characters once again win in .NOFILL mode.) 

            All the in text command characters should now work on centered, spread,
                    etc.,  lines, and in the header.  Those in-text characters which
                    make sense to non-XGP devices are:  (control Y), begin underscore;
                     (control X), end underscore; and  (control F), font switch,
                    which makes sense because of .ULFONT). Other in-text commands are
                    ignored if not to the XGP.

            H_i_d_d_e_n_ _h_y_p_h_e_n_s_ work!

            ^_C_ _(_c_o_n_t_r_o_l_ _C_)_ is now read by TJ6 like any other input character, but TECO
                    makes these difficult to insert.  Also they are not typed out in
                    block mode .IOTs to teletypes, due to a system "feature".

            Characters which have been quoted (with the quoting character), will be
                    printed on the XGP in "normal" mode.  E.G., quoting character
                    followed by a backspace will print as lambda, rather than
                    backspace.  To turn this off use:
                     ._N_O_R_M_A_L_ _n_ -- if no argument or n=0, turns off "normalization" of
                    quoted characters to the XGP, otherwise turns it on.  This command
                    does not break.

            The following "abbreviations" and command names have been flushed in favor
                    of others:

                     .CM -- use .C or .COMMENT
                     .CO -- use .FI or .FILL

                     .PL (for .PAPER) -- use .TL  (.PAPER will soon go away)
                     .PS -- use .PL (.PSIZE will soon go away.)
                     .L -- use .TW (.LINE will go away.)
                     .PAPERW -- use .PW (.PAPERW will go away.)
            The prior four new names are mnemonic for T_ext L_ength, P_aper L_ength, T_ext
                    W_idth, and P_aper W_idth.  The following have been changed:

            ._P_H_P_1_ -- again takes no argument, and simply causes the header to be
                    printed on page one.

            ._S_E_C_T_ -- now does a .BLOCK 2, so that a section title will not be the last
                    line on an output page.

            ._X_G_P_ and /_X_ -- now are equivalent.  If output is to DSK, they: do a .SINCH
                    8.5,6,11,8; a .HVW 25,6,16;  and try to output an XGPLPT command
                    page.

            Handling of s_p_a_c_e_s_, ?_ _._ _!_, and ;_ _:_ has been changed.  In .NOFILL mode, they
                    continue to get no special treatment.  In fill mode, they have two
                    spaces inserted afterwards only if followed by a carriage return or

                    line feed.  There is a n_e_w_ _m_o_d_e_, .HALFAD, in which the text is
                    filled, but not adjusted, and in which spaces and ?_._!_:_;_ are treated
                    the same as in .ADJUST mode.  The gist of this treatment is that
                    two spaces will be inserted after ._!_?_:_;_ at the end of a clause or
                    sentence, and that more than one space or tab in a row (except at
                    the start of an input line,) is treated like one space.  NNTJ6's
                    algorithm for determining the end of sentence or clause is:
                                               A_B_._C_D_
                    The . is always treated like the end of a clause or sentence if C
                    is a carriage return or line feed;  otherwise, This is n_o_t_ the end
                    of a sentence or clause if:
                    1 B is a number;
                    2 B is a letter and A is a space, tab, or one of ._!_?_;_:_;
                    3 C is not a space, tab, carriage return, line feed, or one or more
                    of the following:  )_"_'_]_;
                    4 C is one or more of )_"_'_]_, and D is not a space, tab, carriage
                    return, or line feed.
                    (In cases like A_B_._)_ _, the spaces are inserted after the )_.) 
                    If you don't like the special treatment of some of these
                    characters, turn one off with:
            ._P_E_R_I_O_D_ _n_ _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_ -- which turns off special treatment of c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_ if
                    n=0, otherwise, turns it on.
                    ._P_E_R_I_O_D_ with no argument, still turns off special treatment of all
                    of ._!_?_;_:_.

            M_E_M_O_ is now the default output name instead of (MEMO).

            out the inside of TJ6, and I am unwilling to put in new features.  Please
            don't waste my time by asking for a .UPSIDEDOWN command, or whatever's your
            penchant.  However, if you feel you absolutely must have a new feature, you
            may go about it as follows:
            1)  Obtain three "TJ6 Suggested Improvement Forms" 
                    from Suzin Jabari.  (These will be available in a couple of weeks.)
            2)  Fill them out, and give one copy to Marvin, one copy to Berthold, and
                    one copy to me.
            Your request will be carefully filed.

		NEW TJ6 COMMANDS
			RWW  2/27/74

CHANGED COMMANDS:

.PHP1		New .PHP1 takes arg.  0 means dont print header on page
		one; not 0 means print it.  Default is 0.  .DPHP1 is gone.


NEW COMMANDS:

.CHAP	   (argument is chapter number).  
	Once this command is executed, all pages will be numbered as
	xx.yy, where xx is the chapter number and yy is the page
	number.  For example, ".chap 4" will cause the pages to be
	numbered 4.1, 4.2, etc.  Note that chap also causes the page
	number to be reset to one.  This means that the first page
	of a chapter is not numbered (since it should probably have
	a heading).

.HE1		These two set the left (HE1) and right half of the
.HE2		header line to the fllowing text line.  The page # is
		put between them.

.HDFONT		Causes font <arg> to be used for all headers.
		Font 0 is the default.


Another in-text command character:

~Fd		Select font d where d is digit immediately
		following the ~f.  d can be 0-3.



				RWW   2/8/74

.SPAGE		Set page number to arg.

.PHP1		causes header/page number to be printed on page 1.

( .DPHP1		Dont print header on page one.)

.RLINE		Decrease the line length by arg.

.SELECT .SF	Generate XGPLPT commands to select font arg.

.PSCORE		Sets position of underline.  Arg = 0 will put it
		at base line of font; arg + will move it down.

.BSCORE		Begin under score. (use at own risk.)

.ESCORE		End underscore.         "  (Takes arg as in .PSCORE.)

.BLADJUST	Send xgp commands that cause text to move up or down
		by arg.  (+ is up)  Sticks until next
.SELECT.

.BLUP		SET BASE UP AMOUNT. (+ IS UP) INITIALLY 12

.BLDOWN		SET BASE DOWN AMOUNT.  (+ IS DOWN)  "


IF ONE OF THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS IS ENCOUNTERED IN THE
TEXT,  IT HAS AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT.

  CHAR		EFFECT

 ^A	CAUSE BASELINE TO BE MOVED UP BY "BASE UP AMOUNT".

 ^K	CAUSE BASELINE TO BE MOVED DOWN BY "BASE DOWN AMOUNT".



Ntj6 now will produce files that will accomodate underlined text on the XGP.
	Using the command ".xgp" will enable this format output,
	as will typing "X" somewhere in the command line. In addition, /x
	will also force the page specifications so that the resulting output
	will fit in the default XGP page size.


Ntj6 will also read commands from the jcl command line in ddt.
	I.E. typing ":ntj6 filenam1 filenam2" will produce "filename1 (memo)".

THE NTJ6 CURRENTLY ON SYS: HAS TWO NEW COMMANDS...

.FNAME		INSERTS NAME OF THE FILE BEING INPUTTED FROM,IN THE
		FORMAT 'DEV:SNAME;FN1 FN2'

.DATE		INSERTS CURRENT DATE IN FORMAT 'MM/DD/YY'

BOTH ARE PRELIMINARY AND NEITHER IS CLAIMED TO CERTIFIED
BUG-FREE....

'!<CR>' NOW MAKES TJ6 TOPLEVEL AND FLUSHES HACTRN, AS IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO. 'Q<CR>' LOGS YOU OUT, ^_^Z REPLACES TJ6 WITH HACTRN
AGAIN.


THIS INFO DESCRIBES ADDITIONS TO TJ6 MADE
AFTER THE TJ6 MEMO  (164A) WAS PUBLISHED.


THE ALGORITHM FOR DECIDING WHEN A PERIOD 
SHOULD BE USED FOR JUSTIFICATION HACKS 
(I.E. HAVE TWO SPACES INSERTED AFTER IT 
ETC.) IS NOW A BIT MORE REASONABLE.

COMMANDS CAN NOW BE ENTERED AT THE TOP 
OF EACH PAGE (WHEN TJ6 HALTS TO ACCEPT 
A CHARACTER FROM YOU), BY TYPING LF 
INSTEAD OF SPACE. IT IS NOT YET KNOWN IF 
THIS FEATURE REALLY WINS.

.SP AND .SPACE NOW HAVE IDENTICAL ACTIONS 
(I.E. BOTH TRY TO BE CLEVER ABOUT NOT 
GENERATING BLANK LINES AT THE TOP OF A 
PAGE ETC.)

.LS TURNS OFF THE HEURISTICS FOR .SP AND 
.SPACE.

.STPCHR  DEFINES A CHARACTER WHICH WILL 
NOT BE PRINTED ON OUTPUT, BUT WILL CAUSE 
TJ6 TO WAIT UNTIL YOU TYPE A SPACE (SO 
YOU CAN CHANGE GOLF-BALLS FOR INSTANCE).

.HYPCHR DEFINES A CHARACTER WHICH WILL 
NOT NORMALLY BE PRINTED ON OUTPUT UNLESS
IT GETS USED TO BREAK A WORD, IN WHICH 
CASE IT IS REPLACED BY "-".
(HIDDEN-HYPHEN FEATURE).

.QTECHR DEFINES A CHARACTER WHICH WILL 
QUOTE THE FOLLOWING CHARACTER (SO IT 
WILL LOSE ITS SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE).

.DUMCHR DEFINES A CHARACTER WHICH WILL 
BE OUTPUT AS SPACE, BUT BE TREATED 
INTERNALLY AS A LETTER.

.SPREAD CONSIDERS THE NEXT LINE AS 
COMPOSED OF 3 STRINGS, THE FIRST OF 
WHICH IS TO BE LEFT-ADJUSTED, THE SECOND 
CENTERED AND THE THIRD RIGHT-ADJUSTED
(ALL IN THE SAME LINE).
THE STRINGS ARE SEPARATED BY 
A SEPARATOR DEFINED BY THE FIRST 
CHARACTER ON THAT LINE.
SOME OR ALL OF THE STRINGS MAY BE NULL.

.INSRT <FILE-NAME> WILL INSERT THE FILE 
<FILE-NAME>. INSERTIONS MAY NOT BE 
NESTED MORE THAN 8 DEEP.

.APPND <FILE-NAME> WILL APPEND THE FILE 
<FILE-NAME> (AND IGNORE THE REST OF 
THE CURRENT FILE).

.OF INCREASES THE INDENTING BY <ARG>
AFTER THE NEXT LINE IS OUTPUT.
