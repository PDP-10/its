Description of FTP commands, as or 2/5/77


Some Useful FTP Commands:

CONNECT <host>	Connects to a foreign host.  Use the name of the host
		or its (octal) numeric address.  Any pre-existing
		connection will be flushed.
		FTP prompts with "$$" when it is not connected to
		a foreign host, and with "$" when a connection exists.

<host>		Is equivalent to CONN <host>.

HOSTS		Lists the names of hosts which FTP knows

LOGIN <name>	Logs in at foreign host (if needed by that host)
		If you get an error message implying that you are not
		logged in, this is where to start.  Sometimes FTP
		will figure out by itself that logging in is what you
		have to do;  then it will ask for for a user name,
		send it, and go ahead with the operation you had
		already requested.

TEN		Mode command for pdp10 36 bit binary files.
		(May also be used for pdp10 ascii files if you don't
		mind extraneous characters at the end of the file)
		NOTE: This is the DEFAULT mode when communicating with
		another PDP10.  You can specify it explicitly, also,
		with any computer (although some may not accept it).
		It is an abbreviation for TYPE I and BYTE 36

TEXT		Mode command for Network ASCII data transmission.
		This mode is the DEFAULT when communicating with a
		machine that is not a PDP10.  It is an abbreviation
		for TYPE A and BYTE 8.

GET or RETRIEVE	Transfers a file from foreign host to here.
		Asks for local name (end with CR) and then foreign name.

PUT or STORE	Transfers a file from here to foreign host.
  or SEND	Asks for local name (end with CR) and then foreign name.

APPEND		Appends a local file onto a file at the foreign host.
		Arguments are local file (not changed by the operation)
		followed by the foreign file (which will be created if
		it does not exist), as for PUT.

TRAN <host1><file1>=<host2><file2>
		Transfers <file2> at <host2> to <file1> at <host1>.
		Two foreign hosts can't be used, though;  one of
		<host1> and <host2> must be the local host's name.
		Abbreviations are allowed:  You can leave out the
		name of the local host (omitting the altmode as well),
		as in TRAN FOO BAR=MCFOO BAR or TRAN MCFOO BAR=X Y,
		and if the two filespecs are identical either one may
		be omitted, as in TRAN FOO BAR=MC which is equivalent
		to TRAN FOO BAR=MCFOO BAR.
		NOTE:  "_" is equivalent to "=".  To include a "=" or
		"_" or a ^Q in a filename in a TRAN command, precede
		it with a ^Q (which will be gobbled up as a quoter).
		^Q's followed by other characters (not _, = or ^Q)
		will NOT be absorbed by TRAN (so you can use them to
		quote at other levels, with hosts that understand it).

QUIT		Closes connection to foreign host, and then exit from FTP

^C		Is the same as QUIT - no CR is needed.
		Any command may be terminated with a ^C instead of a
		CR, in which case that command will be followed by
		a QUIT (unless it encounters an error).

DISC		Closes connection to foreign host.  You may then connect
		to another host, or QUIT, or ^Z...

HELP or ?	Types a list of commands, with brief descritions.


Less useful commands:

DELETE <file>	Deletes the specified file at the foreign host.

RENAME <oldname>
       <newname>
		Renames the file <oldname> at the foreign host to be
		called <newname>.  Separate the two names with a CR.

DIRECTORY <dir> or
LISTF <dir>	Types out a listing of the foreign host's directory <dir>.
		Some hosts may also allow you to specify a filename,
		in which case info on that file will be given.

LISTB <dir>	Types out a brief listing of a foreign directory.
		It is like LISTF except that onlty the filenames are
		typed - no other info on the files.

LISTL <dir>	Types out a listing of the directory <dir> at
		the local host.

CWD <dir>	Sets the foreign default directory to <dir>

DEFAULTS <filenames>
		Sets the local filename defaults to <filenames>.
		Note:  the local defaults are sticky;  each local
		filename's names default to the last filenames
		specified for a local file.


Rarely Useful Commands:

STATUS <arg>	Asks for a status message from the foreign host.
		The meaning of <arg> is site-dependent.  ITS sites
		don't implement the command at all.

QUOTE <command>	Sends <command> directly to the foreign host over
		the TELNET connection.  Used if the foreign host
		implements some simple command that FTP doesn't know
		about itself.  It won't work for commands that do
		anything hairy (such as use the data connection at
		all) since FTP doesn't expect it do do that.

SOAK		Waits for and describes one reply from the server.
		This is never necessary with any of the normal
		FTP commands, since they know when to wait for
		replies.

DEBUG		Toggles the switch which says whether to print expected
		replies from the server (unexpected replies such as
		error messages and notices to the user are always
		printed).  The DEBUG switch also causes reply codes
		to be given with all replies, not just error messages.

PASS <password>	Sends a password to a foreign host.  Note that after
		a LOGIN command, if a password is needed, FTP will
		usually be able to figure that out;  it will ask you
		for the password and send it automatically, so you
		need not explicitly give a PASSWORD command.

ACCT <account>	Sends an account number to the foreign host.  Note
		that if after a LOGIN command an account number is
		needed, FTP will usually figure that out and just
		ask you for it.  So you usually won't need to give
		an explicit ACCT command.

BYE		Is like QUIT, but it notifies the foreign host
		with a BYE command before closing the connection.
		Is this ever useful?  ^C is easier.

ALLOCATE <size>	Sends the foreign host the estimated size of a file
		you are about to send it (measured in bytes).  Most
		hosts don't need ALLOCATE commands since they can
		allocate file storage dynamically.

TYPE <type>	Says what transfer type to use.  Of the many types
		specified in the FTP protocol, only A (ASCII) and
		I (Image) are implemented on ITS.  You usually
		would rather use the TEXT or TEN commands, since
		they specify the two most useful combinations of
		TYPE and BYTE.

BYTE <size>	Says what byte size to use for transfers.  The only
		byte sizes implemented on ITS for FTP'ing are 8,
		32 and 36.  In any case, you should usually use the
		TEXT and TEN commands for mode-setting.


Giving FTP commands from DDT:

If you do :FTP <command> and <command> contains an = or a _,
FTP automatically does a TRAN command with <command>
as arguments.  After that transfer completes, FTP
kills itself.  For example, :FTP FOO BAR=MC will
transfer FOO BAR from MC to the local host, leaving
you back in DDT.

If the command string from DDT does not contain an = or a _,
it is simply executed as an FTP command.  FTP will then read
more commands from the TTY, since one FTP command (unless it
is TRAN) is not usually enough for a whole transaction.


Filename Defaulting:

Local filenames default "stickily", so that each file's device,
sname, and first and second filenames all default to the last
such names specified for a local file.
Giving a null argument for the local file will cause the default
file to be used.
When you specify only one filename, it is the first filename,
and ">" is used as the second.
The initial default directory is your working directory.

If you wish to include a space, colon, or semicolon in a local
filename (or in a foreign filename if the foreign site is an ITS),
precede it with a ^Q.  The same technique is used for including
a = or _ or ^Q anywhere in a pathname, in the TRAN command.


Type-in Conventions:

You can use Rubout to delete one character, ^D, ^G or ^U to
cancel an entire line, and ^L to redisplay the current line
as typed so far.  Commands with no arguments should be terminated
with a CR.  When giving a command with arguments, you can
separate the command name from the first argument with either
a space or a CR (if you use CR, FTP will tell you what sort
of argument is expected).  When a command requires several
arguments, the arguments are separated with CRs.

You can use a ^C instead of CR to terminate a line.  That
causes FTP to return to DDT, killing itself, after the current
command is finished (as long as it does not get an error).
If you plan to disown a FTP while it is transfering, you should
end the last command with a ^C so that the FTP will go away
when it is finished;  otherwise it might hang around for hours
until someone notices it and kills it.

You can use ^N instead of CR to terminate a line.  This is not
especially useful when you are typing on the TTY, but it is
useful when passing commands from DDT, since it allows you to
put several lines' worth of input into the one line that DDT lets
you send.
