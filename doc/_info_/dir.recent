	NAME1 <fname> & NAME2 <fname>, where <fname> is not UP or DOWN,
	 first gives files whose specified name matches <fname>, then
	 ones after it (in ASCENDING order), and then ones before it, with
	 each group preceded by a line of dashes.

	Changed format of links.

	Do syntax check before opening directory.
	Use right-justified numbers for comparison.

36	(7/26/75 GROSS)  Use 777777 for link's flen,
	 and change MAXCHS to reflect the fact that if you have
	 the max # of files, each will have at most a 3 char
	 length (being n.m).
	Add decoding for DIRxxx devices.
	Separate pure & impure stuff.

35	Clean up a lot:
	 Flush GCDIR in favor of faster SUBSET.

32	(7/22/75 GROSS) Pass back the real error code
	 when the directory open fails.

31	(7/22/75 GROSS) Do ascii open so TTY will work.

30	(7/21/75 GROSS)  Flush lots of extraneous krud.
	Have file-length give 1 decimal place.
	Put referenced-date in the output.
	Add "SIZE" as an alias for "LENGTH".
	Add device hackery:
	 DIR:		Works normally.
(36)	 DIR<foo>:	Like DIR:, but uses device <foo>:
(36)			 For example,  DIRML:LUSER;RDATE DOWN
	 JOB:		Loses.
	 Anything else is treated like DSK:
	  .FILE. (DIR)	 ACTS LIKE  NAME1 UP
	  .FILE. +<foo>	 ACTS LIKE  ONLY <foo>
	  .FILE. -<foo>  ACTS LIKE  NOT <foo>
(40)	  .FILE. /<foo>	 ACTS LIKE  <foo> UP
(40)	  .FILE. \<foo>	 ACTS LIKE  <foo> DOWN
	  <NAME> ******	 ACTS LIKE  FIRST <NAME>
(37)	  <NAME> ######  ACTS LIKE  FIRST# <NAME>
	  ****** <NAME>	 ACTS LIKE  SECOND <NAME>
	To use these features, tell DDT
	 AI *: *; .FILE. *,	DIR:
	 AI *: *; ****** *,	DIR:
	 AI *: *; * ******,	DIR:
(37)	 AI *: *; * ######,	DIR:

29	(3/30/75 PDL) Put insert files into this file.
	Added new modes: CDATE>, CDATE=, CDATE<, same for RDATE,

28	(3/25/75 PDL) Changed to give MODE NOT AVAILABLE if files
	 not from legal list instead of just giving directory
	 untouched.

------- DIR ORDER updated to this point. -------
