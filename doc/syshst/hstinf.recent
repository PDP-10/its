   Can you tell me how to obtain an up-to-date hosts file?  Thanks.

There are a bunch of automaticly maintained tables (various formats
and subsets) available via anonymous FTP from mintaka.lcs.mit.edu in
the directory hosts/misc.  If there's a particular format or subset
you want that's not present, ask, we may be generating it and just not
bothering to export it.

NB: If you want the NIC table, -please- get it from mintaka or from
bitsy.mit.edu, not from the NIC (per request of the NIC staff).

Here's what's currently in mintaka.lcs.mit.edu:~anonymous/hosts/misc:

  -rw-r--r--  1 root         3562 Dec 11 04:58 chaoshosts.chaos-only

Automaticly generated list of names of hosts that are only reachable
by chaosnet, for sendmail.cf routing kludge.

  -rw-r--r--  1 root       690896 Dec 11 04:59 hosts.nic

Verbatim copy of NIC host table (NIC.DDN.MIL:NETINFO:HOSTS.TXT).

  -rw-r--r--  1 root        37224 Dec 11 04:59 hosts2.txt

Automaticly generated HOSTS2 host table for MIT chaosnet.

  -rw-r--r--  1 root       165346 Dec 11 04:59 hstcamp.txt

(Almost) verbatim copy of bitsy.mit.edu:~anonymous/hosts/hstcamp.txt
(we run it through an AWK script to get the number of ":" characters
per line right, the verbatim table from MIT Telecommunications
violates RFC-810 (et al) syntax rules).

  -rw-r--r--  1 root       112326 Dec 11 04:59 hstlcs.txt

Verbatim copy of LCS host table as generated from Lisp Machine
namespace (AI: SYSHST; HSTLCS >).

  -rw-r--r--  1 root       149480 Dec 11 04:59 hstmit.txt

Automaticly generated "MIT" host table.  Does not currently include
hstcamp.txt for historical reasons; this should be fixed someday.

  -rw-r--r--  1 root        14091 Dec 11 04:59 hstnet.txt

Also he will soon have a small local Chaosnet, and will need a second

He and I both realize that there is no real need to coordinate subnet
numbers, since it is unlikely that we will ever join the two Chaosnets, but
who knows?  We have numbers to spare it seems.  (Will LMI ever want its 9
reserved subnet numbers?) 

Any objections?  I presume I just edit AI:SYSHST;HSTNET appropriately?

Kevin -

Because of the size of the Host Table and the push toward the use of
the domain system, we are not registering individual internet hosts
that are already under fully-registered domains.

Since the host mentioned in your message is within the MIT.EDU domain,
and therefore fully accessible to the Internet community, we can not
register it in the Host Table.

If you have any other concerns, please let us know.


Thanks -

What's the general feeling about adding workstations to the MIT hosts
tables?  I have about 25, possibly expanding to 35 or 40.  We rarely
need to talk directly to them, but it would be nice if the nameservers knew 
enough about them to be able to answer IN-ADDR type queries...  any feeling
about whether or not to add them?

After the dust settled, the most reasonable suggestion was to turn off
the automatic nickname generation in the host table compiler job.  So
all the MIT-foo.ARPA nicknames, etc, will no longer be present in
future tables.  Sites which still use this stuff might want to
consider updating any instances of MIT-foo names to the real
cannonical names now, before the last copies of the old tables become
inaccessable.

The list of changes caused by this is so large that the SRCCOM will
not be sent out as a mail message to INFO-HOSTS-UPDATE; interested
parties should look in XX:<HOSTS> for the diffs.

At this point I am unlikely to make changes to the code except to fix
major bugs on XX or the ITS machines; pleas for other changes will be
listened to but are unlikely to be acted upon.

The HOSTS3 compiler ran out of address space again, and I've run out of
clever ideas for how to automaticly discard useless information to make
everything important fit again.  So unless somebody comes up with some
bright idea, this means the end of the comprehensive HOSTS3 table
and its derivatives.  There is no problem with continuing to produce
the chaosnet host tables,  although at the moment that process is
also stopped due to the breakage of the comprehensive table.

Once again I ask that anybody left using the comprehensive table
make themselves known.  We already know about the ITS machines.
Anyone else?  If I don't hear loud screams (and suggestions)
I'll assume that from this point on the HOSTS3 table stuff is
an ITS internal maintainance issue of no interest to anyone else.

I just spent a frustrating time connected to WC from MIT-TAC (I was
trying to keep load off Terminus, and had misplaced the direct phone
numbers).

Coming in from the TAC, with me as the only non-idle user on WC, I got
extremely bursty I/O.  It came about a line at a time, with an average
speed of about 300 baud on a 1200 baud connection.  This looks like
some fairly repeatable network lossage combined with a smallish buffer
(one line is much less than 576 octets...).

I hung up and came in through Terminus immediately thereafter.  No
problems, normal I/O.

Has anyone else experienced problems with the TAC?  I've never had
this bursty behavior talking to other AI/LCS hosts, though it's been a
while since I've used the TAC, and this could be new behavior.

SPEECH will be going out of service sometime in October.  This means
that the gateway between subnets 1 and 033 (provided by SPEECH-11) will
very probably disappear as well.  This will leave BYPASS as the primary
(perhaps the only) subnet 1 gateway on this side of the tracks.

EECS-11 is listed in HSTEE as having an address on sn 076 (37142) and in
the Lispm namespace as having an address on sn 025 (12542).  At the
current writing, neither of these appear in its routing table.

PLASMA is listed in HSTG & the namespace as being on subnet 1, but it
doesn't seem to be there either.  There's also something called EETEST
in the namespace that doesn't seem to be out there.

I forgot a paragraph in the previous message.

The naming authority for a given subnet should not be confused with
some kind of limitation on the names of the hosts on that subnet; the
naming authority field simply specifies which zone's nameservers have
responsibility for providing the IN-ADDR data.  Eg, there are a number
of AI lab machines on subnet 18.26.0.0, but LCS is responsible for
providing the IN-ADDR data for subnet 18.26.0.0.  Think of "the naming
authority for this subnet is FOO" as meaning "the nameservers that are
authoritative for the FOO zone are also authoritative for the IN-ADDR
data for this subnet".

Subject: machine readable subnet table in AI:SYSHST;HSTNET >

I finally had sufficient motivation to design (with some help from
Mike Patton) a machine readable syntax for the master MIT subnet table
that lives on AI.  I've placed a copy of the file in the usual place
(AI: SYSHST; HSTNET >).

Comments and corrections welcome.  Please indicate whether your
comments/corrections refer to the SYNTAX of the table or the DATA that
is presently in the table; Mike and I are well aware that some of the
data is horribly out of date.

If the comments and the syntax are clear enough that you understand
the table, please feel free (nay, encouraged) to update anything you
know to be obsolete.  If the syntax or comments are too opaque, please
say so.

The data I'm trying to distribute via this table is the following:
 1) Subnet masks for all known MIT networks.
 2) Which IP network (one at most) a given subnet is part of.
 3) Which portion of MIT is the naming authority for a particular
    subnet (eg, LCS owns subnet 18.26.0.0); the notation is less
    general than the domain system itself, but seems sufficient for
    the way we allocate subnets and domains at MIT.
 4) Whether or not this subnet is believed to be allocated properly
    (ie, whether there is a known conflict with this subnet because
    somebody didn't follow the rules).
 5) A text string indicating physical location and/or a contact.

Eventually I hope to have a program that will do some kind of
automated consistancy checking of this table against both itself and
the combined MIT host tables so that it can notify the appropriate
people if somebody does something weird.

The proximate cause of all this is that I need to automate the
proceedure by which the LCS zone file constructor job figures out
which subnets of net 18 LCS currently owns so that it can generate the
right IN-ADDR zone files.

on XX and the ITS machines, due to a problem with the LCS lispm namespace.
XX, the ITS machines, and the LCS domain nameservers have been backed out
of the bad generated files.  I'll turn the updater back on as soon as the
problem is under control.

Would whoever keeps adding Athena's DIALUP (aka M11-111-1.MIT.EDU)
machine to the Tech Square namespaces please come talk to me?  I'm
getting tired of deleting it, presumably you're getting tired of
adding it too.

Subject: Host table generation tweaks & impending death of global HOSTS3 table

People who are both interested and alert will have noticed that host
table compilation has been broken for the last few weeks.  I finally
bit the bullet and tightened up the TECO code a bit to get rid of some
unnecessary nicknames, because we needed to get Bloom-Beacon.MIT.EDU
into the tables ASAP.

The new code will only generate the various nicknames for the primary
short name of a host.  Eg,

HOST : xxx : FOOBAR,FOO : .... :

now becomes

HOST : xxx : FOOBAR.LCS.MIT.EDU,MIT-FOOBAR.ARPA,MIT-FOOBAR,FOOBAR,FOO : ... :

Formerly, it would have also gotten names FOO.LCS.MIT.EDU,
MIT-FOO.ARPA, and MIT-FOO.  The change saves a few pages of string
space, which made the difference in getting the compiler to run again.
The one exception to this rule is that VX.LCS.MIT.EDU, by special
dispensation, still gets the full range of nicknames for their former
name (MIT-VAX), since that's still their primary name on Usenet.
Hosts in the AI lab table are uneffected by this change; if I find the
time I'll probably switch all the tables in AI: SYSHST; over to work
the way HSTAI does so that I can stop maintaining this silly nickname
generation code.

This is about as far as I can take the various tricks without removing
stuff that people think is essential.  The next casualty will probably
be all names of the form "MIT-foo" and "MIT-foo.ARPA".  I expect that
there will be a lot of weeping and wailing when this happens.  The
time after that, we'll have no choice but to start removing hosts from
one of the tables (or remove one of the tables entirely, or remove all
nicknames from hosts in the NIC table, or something equally drastic).

Hostmasters and Postmasters are hereby warned that I expect the
comprehensive HOSTS3 table generation effort to stop working for good
sometime within the next year and should plan accordingly.

Reply-To: Internet-Contacts-Request@LCS.MIT.EDU

As part of cleaning up the list of SysAdmins and contact points for
LCS in the NIC's records, I split the list INTERNET-CONTACTS@XX into
two sublists; mail to INTERNET-CONTACTS will still reach both lists.

INTERNET-CONTACTS-ROUTINE is for people who want to receive both
emergency messages and routine stuff like notifications of new host
tables, DDN management bulletins, etcetera.

INTERNET-CONTACTS-ACTION-ONLY is for people who only want to get
emergency messages from the NIC.  This is primarily intended for LCS
sysadmins, but anybody can join if they so desire.

For those who don't remember, I set up INTERNET-CONTACTS back in '85
to protect the NIC from having to know email addresses for each and
every administrator of each and every VAX 750 at MIT.  Here in the
future, the problem is even worse than it was then, so I'm trying to
resurect interest in using this list.  Once I sort through the list of
hosts that the NIC currently has on file, I'll be asking to have all
the LCS hosts list INTERNET-CONTACTS as the email address for the
point of contact in the Registrar database, regardless of who is
system administrator of the host this week.

NIC people: Please change all occurrences of "INTERNET-CONTACTS@XX" in
the lists of recipients for routine matters (host table notifications,
DDN MGT messages, etcetera) to INTERNET-CONTACTS-ROUTINE@LCS.MIT.EDU.

INTERNET-CONTACTS people: please let me know which list, if either,
you want to be on.

Following message forwarded from the BitNet source FYI:
-Rich
-------------------------------------------------------



As has been announced in a number of places, the Internet <-> BITNET gateway 
at WISCVM (WISCVM.WISC.EDU) is going away.  The final date for using that 
gateway is Dec 15, 1987.

BITNET has been working with the Internet administration to provide a set of 
multiple regional gateways between the two networks.  Until that time when a 
suitable technical solution is developed, an interim solution has been put in
place, effective immediately.

From the BITNET side, mail should be sent to SMTP@INTERBIT.  The node is 
currently in the tables distributed by BITNIC, and now points towards CUNYVM.
 At a later date, this will point to the appropriate regional gateway.  The 
distributed DOMAIN NAMES file is being updated to point at SMTP@INTERBIT 
instead of SMTP@WISCVM.  The updated file will be distributed as the normal 
distribution on Monday, Dec 7.  All sites, especially those other than end 
nodes, should ensure that the latest tables are installed.

For those on the Internet side, the first of the gateways is at 
CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU (CUNYVM on the BITNET side).  Any mail formerly sent to 
user%node.BITNET@WISCVM.WISC.EDU should now be sent to 
user%node.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU.  This is an interim solution until the full
set of gateways is in place.  At that time, notice will be sent out giving 
details of the new gateways.

Those users on other networks who use WISCVM as a gateway to BITNET need to 
modify their mailer tables appropriately.

The code running in the gateway is fully compatible with the code currently 
running at the WISCVM gateway.  Any mail which worked at the WISCVM gateway 
will work with the CUNYVM gateway.

If any problems are experienced, you may direct any discussion to 
POSTMASTER@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU.

Note:  The node CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU on the Internet is the same as CUNYVM.BITNET.
 This node now has a direct connection to the Internet.

I updated MILO.LCS.MIT.EDU:/etc/nameserver/ns.ca to know about the
current list of nameservers (the list changed drasticly this week).
ALLSPICE.LCS.MIT.EDU has also been updated.  Maintainers of other LCS
unix machines should copy the file from milo to wherever it lives on
the local machine (/etc/nameserver/ns.ca under LCS 4.2, /etc/named.ca
under LCS ultrix and LCS 4.3).  Non-LCS people are welcome to copy the
file too, but I make no promise that it has what you want.

Two other things.  First, ALLSPICE.LCS.MIT.EDU still hasn't made it
into the list of authoritative nameservers for LCS, although I know
that the MIT zone files have been updated at least once since Tim
Shepard requested this.  Telecomunications people, please take care of
this (yes, Jeff, I'm still smiling at this point, no flames yet).

Second, I don't know how many of the people receiving this message
read Namedroppers@NIC, so I'm enclosing a recent message from Paul
Mockapetris on the subject of antisocial resolvers.  I agree with Paul
that the only way this will ever be fixed is by running banner
headlines pointing at the guilty parties.  Some of the real losers are
here at MIT, so please read this if you haven't seen it already.

Re:   Who's bad?

One of the problems with the root service is that there are a lot of
host sourcing bad requests of various flavors.  While I realize that
many people have better things to do than to play with their domain
software, I believe that a little peer pressure could go a long way
toward cleaning up the mess.

I suggest that you check the following list to determine whether your
hosts are good, bad or ugly.  Sending bogons or too many requests are
the issues.  Busy hosts may need to send a lot of requests, but some
of the traffic really looks excessive.  I'd also appreciate it if you
could send me (not the list) a message identifying good and bad
implementations/versions; I'll send out a summary.

For the purposes of this discussion, a bogon is a domain packet
received by the server which is a response, not a request.  Most
bogons appear to ask for the NS RRs for the root.  The TOPS-20 root
servers don't respond to bogons, and I believe newer versions of BIND
also toss bogons.  Please don't "fix" your machine by having it clear
the response bit; there is no good reason to ask for root server
changes every minute anyway.  They just don't change that often.

The statistics are for the root server on ISIA
between 19-Nov-87 03:20:22 and 19-Nov-87 21:11:22)

Name server requests:28654 Bogons:50085 Parse fails:1
27.8 queries/min 48.5 bogons/min 0.0 parse failure/min

(That's right, the server is ignoring almost 2/3 of its input)

(In the following table, the Start column gives the raw count of
packets from the specified Host, and the Done column is the number of
responses sent.  More than 99% of the difference is due to bogons.
The %Done column is the percentage of good traffic from the specified
host.  The average time is elapsed ms between reading the packet and
finishing with it, and only includes good transactions.  No, I don't
totally understand the time differences; yes, the times are a bit
suspect, but there are some wierd factors involved.

For example, the first host, ADS.ARPA, seems well behaved.  It sent in
102 requests and got 102 answers.  The second in the list, 128.6.14.2,
sent in 1654 bogons, all of which were ignored. Its bad.)

Subject: WARNING -- HOSTS3.BIN and friends being pruned some more

As some of you may have noticed, XX hasn't been generating new HOSTS3
tables for about a week now.  The HOSTS3 compiler ran out of address
space again.  It has gotten to the point where there is simply no
addres space left to reallocate, again.  So, I made the table pruning
code more obnoxious.  It will now completely remove non-MIT hosts that
it thinks are workstations, such as IBM-PCs, rather than just removing
nicknames for such hosts.

Beware of bad table versions for the next few days.  I may discover
the hard way that I've pruned out some essential host; I was going to
remove all SUN machines except at SUN.COM, until I realized that
RUTGERS.EDU is now a SUN.

Please send me mail if you think you've been screwed by this.

A friend of mine ran into this problem...systems using domain
name resolvers seem to be able to figure out who 'penguin.zbt.mit.edu'
is, but it doesn't appear in the ITS host tables, so, at the least,
MC doesn't know it.

The root server set for the domain system will change in October.

The C.ISI.EDU machine is going to its just reward, and its name server
will stop some time in October.  Toast its demise with a root bier.  The
NIC will remove it from the domain database approximately one week in
advance.  Gunter-Adam.arpa will join the official set of root servers
before C's demise.

As a more long term solution, shakedown of several new root servers
"closer" to the east coast, NSFnet, etc is underway, and should be
provide a long term solution.

On Saturday, July 18, the hosts on the SCRC Ethernet (192.10.41.0) are
having their addresses changed to network 128.81.41.0.  The gateways
will still advertise routes to 192.10.41.0 until things settle down.
Please make whatever changes are necessary to your local tables and
namespaces.  The hostmaster@sri-nic has been notified so the domain
servers should get the proper information and a new host table should be
available soon afterwards (we hope).

I have attached the old IRIS cable to the second floor end of the
ethernet cable for subnet 30 (decimal), and moved it in the fourth
floor area from the old IRIS location to the room across from 403.

I have removed Cronkite from subnet 26 (decimal) and added it to
subnet 30 (decimal) via a vampire-style tap on the IRIS cable.
[Old address 18.26.0.89, New address 18.30.0.36]

I have enabled Cls's ethernet board once again, telling it that it
is on subnet 30 decimal, address 18.30.0.35.

I have attempted to update the Symbolics nameservers with this
information, but I'm not sure they like it.

Traffic with Cls currently will probably perform strangely, because
it will be slightly confused by having two interfaces.  I can't
shut the ringnet interface down now, even if I chose to, because
Cls is being used to test the ringnet on the second floor (I
think).

  --Jim

P.S. Anyone knowing the precise length of the subnet 30 (decimal)
     ethernet cables (and/or the IRIS cable) should speak up.  It is
     possible that the addition of the IRIS piece puts it over the
     limit, although I doubt it.

There is a new host table available from the SRI-NIC.ARPA machine.  The
file is NETINFO:HOSTS.TXT and it's version #620.

As announced recently in DDN Management Bulletin 32, all
nondomain-style host names and nicknames are to be removed from the
Official DoD Internet Host Table.  Host names and nicknames appearing
in this version, and in all future versions, of the host table will
conform to domain-style naming conventions.

Many of the old nicknames that users have become accustomed to using
over the years have been discontinued.  Users will have to specify
primary hostnames when sending mail to other users, or when using FTP
or TELNET servers to connect to remote sites.  Although some nicknames
will remain in the table, users should keep in mind that the purpose
of a nickname is to provide a transition name when a host changes its
official name.  The old name becomes a nickname and is kept in the
table for reasonable period of time, after which time it is removed
from the table.

If you have any questions/comments send them to HOSTMASTER@SRI-NIC.ARPA.

Subject: Reader Poll: When can I turn host table installation back on?
To: Info-Hosts@AI.AI.MIT.EDU

I've had automatic host table installation for XX and the ITS machines
(and thus indirectly for the other Twenex machines too) turned off
since 1 April.  The NIC has indeed removed a lot of nicknames from
the tables.

We now have software for ITS and Twenex which can canonicalize the
hostnames in mailing list files.  I think the ITS INQUIR databases
have also been fixed up; it will take another day or so to do this
on the Twenexes running WATSON/HOLMES.  It would be fairly easy
to modify these programs so that they use a different copy of HOSTS3.BIN,
so that they will continue to work if installation of new HOSTS3.BIN
files is resumed.

Unix machines with domain resolvers are presumably not as troubled
by all this.  Other machines will have to fend for themselves.

Would anyone object if I turned automatic installation back on as
soon as the WATSON databases are canonicalized and the Twenex mailing
list code is patched to use some other filename?  If I don't hear
from anybody, I'll just turn things back on once the Twenexes are
ready (I'll send another message when I do this, of course).

Host table generation has been broken for the last few days, first
because the HOSTS3 compiler overflowed its address space while I was
at Boskone, then because of some errors in the latest NIC table.  I
sent the errors along to the NIC for correction, and things should be
back on track as soon as they get around to fixing the bum entries and
issuing a new table.

I know that some new LCS microvaxen have been added to the namespace
while these problems were going on.  If there is anybody who -really-
needs a new table generated -immediately-, let me know and I'll hand
edit a usable table together.  But I'd rather not.

The imminent flushing of all non-domain nicknames from the "host
tables" applies only to the Internet-wide host table maintained by the
NIC.  This does not affect nicknames for MIT hosts listed in the
tables maintained on AI; the tables XX compiles for the PDP-10s (and
friends) do not use the NIC tables for information about MIT hosts.
I've been expecting the NIC to do this for the past year, so I
stopped using the NIC tables for MIT info some time ago.

In other words, as far as the "MIT" (PDP-10) tables are concerned, the
name "XX" will still exist as a nickname for "XX.LCS.MIT.EDU" but
"SAIL" will no longer exist as a nickname for "SAIL.Stanford.EDU".

Information Center under DCA contract as a means of communicating
official policy, procedures and other information of concern to
management personnel at DDN facilities.  Back issues may be read
through the TACNEWS server ("@n" command at the TAC) or may be
obtained by FTP (or Kermit) from the SRI-NIC host [26.0.0.73 or
10.0.0.51] using login="anonymous" and password="guest".  The pathname
for bulletins is DDN-NEWS:DDN-MGT-BULLETIN-nn.TXT (where "nn" is the
bulletin number).
**********************************************************************

              PHASE 1 OF THE DOMAIN NAME IMPLEMENTATION

The DDN Network Information Center (NIC) is directed to remove all
nondomain-style host names and nicknames from the Official DoD Host
Table, NETINFO:HOSTS.TXT, by 31 March 1987.  After that time, names
which do not conform to domain-style naming conventions, i.e. do not
have ".domain" extensions, will not be allowed in either the Official
DoD Host Table or the domain name servers.

Nicknames, or aliases, will not be permitted in either the servers or
the Official Host Table unless authorized.  Network mailers are
required to use primary host names and to accept host names containing
dots (.), as specified in the DDN mail protocols RFC 821 (MILSTD-1781)
and RFC 822.  If mailers are not now adhering to these protocol
requirements, they may experience mail delivery problems when the
nondomain-style names are discontinued.  Users sending electronic mail
should use primary host names in all mail destinations and sources.
If nicknames are used, problems may arise in mail delivery.

The NIC will notify Host Administrators as to which names or nicknames
do not now conform.  Host Administrators may change nonconforming data
by the usual procedure via Network Change Requests (NCRs) and Network
Change Directives (NCDs), if they wish, before the 31 March 1987
deadline.

Host Administrators anticipating problems with this plan should notify
DCA Code B652 (DCAB652@DDN1.ARPA), or via AUTODIN message, and the NIC
Hostmaster (HOSTMASTER@SRI-NIC.ARPA) no later than 2 weeks prior to
the scheduled cutover.

In March of 1984, the DDN began the transition to domain-style names
with the issuance of DDN Management Bulletin 22.  In that bulletin,
all hosts were required to change their primary host names to contain
".domain" extensions in accordance with RFC 897.  At the same time,
all of the old-style names (without the ".domain" extensions) were
automatically declared to be nicknames in the Official Host Table,
NETINFO:HOSTS.TXT.  This use of old-style nicknames was allowed on an
interim basis to make the transition to domain-style naming easier.
Almost three years have passed, and this transition period must now
come to a close.

The transition to naming domains has progressed to the point where
there are many domain name servers implemented and running.  In order
to maintain interoperability between hosts on the DDN using the host
table and hosts using the domain name servers, all hosts must be able
to recognize domain-style names.  It is imperative that all transition
names and nicknames be upgraded to domain-style names or be removed
from NETINFO:HOSTS.TXT so that naming is consistent and so that all
use of names adheres to the specification for domain names adopted in
1984.

All the Media-Lab hosts have been removed from AI: SYSHST; HSTG > and
placed in a new file, HSTMDA >.  This happened late last night.  Since
there were some primary name changes (MEDIA-LAB.MIT.EDU ->
MEDIA-LAB.MEDIA.MIT.EDU, etc) there may be some cleaning up required
on various hosts.  It's a once only deal, I don't think they're
planning on changing names again soon.

Bogus versions of the files XX:<HOSTS>HSTMIT.TXT (AI:SYSHST;HSTMIT >)
and XX:<HOSTS>HOSTS3.TXT were created at 4AM due to brain bubbles on
my part.  The problem has been fixed and a new set of tables has been
generated and installed on XX and ITS.  There never was a set of
HOSTS3 binaries (or any other derived files) corresponding to this
change, so I doubt any machines noticed.  Sorry for any problems (and
the few known heart attacks) this caused.

The EMMA/HYPATIA conflict is due to another name change done at the

because I was able to edit it myself.  The other is awaiting update by
Jeff Schiller.

Subject: Merging the "MIT" host tables and the MIT.EDU domain zones (long)

This is a report on the results of my attempt to produce a single,
coherent host table by merging the ITS ("MIT") host tables with the
MIT.EDU zone (and its children).  The latter was obtained by using
Mark Lottor's program to dump the MIT.EDU zone recursively, then doing
some fixups.  These were: removal of AI and LCS data (already have in
all these bits in more useful form), removal of all entries whose
primary name was a room number (presumably workstations, can't spare
the space with the current technology) or begins with "MIT-" (see
below), and adding a default opsys and cpu type where there wasn't one
listed (see below).  Then I ran the mess through the HOSTS3 compiler.
Most of this message is a listing of the errors that it turned up.

Once we get these resolved, I can set things up so that this process
happens automaticly, as part of the nightly table compilation.  This
will make life easier for getting an accurate listing in the vanilla
case (j random pc in the MIT.EDU zone), and will at least provide a
crosscheck for the more complex cases.

Henry Holtzman and Glenn Adams, you are getting this as the domain
contacts for the MEDIA.MIT.EDU and LL.MIT.EDU zones.  Welcome to the
debating club.  If either of you wants to be added to Info-Hosts, tell
me.  You probably should be, if you are maintaining host table type
things under the MIT.EDU umbrella.

And now the report.

The address for ACHILLES.LL.MIT.EDU (90.0.0.2) looks bogus.  The NIC
table doesn't list network 90.0.0.0, and there aren't any other
addresses like this in the table.  Typographical error?

The following hosts are listed as being in the .ARPA domain in the NIC
table but are listed as being in the LL.MIT.EDU zone according to the
LL.MIT.EDU nameservers.  I can kludge around this, but the NIC data
ought to be updated (there are also some mismatches between NIC and
LL.MIT.EDU on cpu and opsys type for Lincoln Lab hosts):
        10.4.0.10       LL-EN.ARPA      EN.LL.MIT.EDU
        10.0.0.10       LL.ARPA         LL.MIT.EDU
        10.6.0.10       LL-SST.ARPA     SST.LL.MIT.EDU
        10.1.0.10       LL-VLSI.ARPA    VLSI.LL.MIT.EDU
        10.2.0.10       LL-XN.ARPA      XN.LL.MIT.EDU

The three known conflicts from the Athena/RLE namespace war:
KOALA.MIT.EDU           RLE:    SYMBOLICS-3600  Chaos 15435
                        Athena: VAXSTATION      IP 18.72.0.79
MATISSE.MIT.EDU         RLE:    SYMBOLICS-3600  Chaos 15416
                        Athena: VAXSTATION,     IP 18.72.0.214
RENOIR.MIT.EDU          RLE:    SYMBOLICS-3600  Chaos 15415
                        Athena: VAXSTATION      IP 18.72.0.108
This is pending resolution by Jeff Schiller.

The listings for some math department machines seem to be confused.
Ray Hirschfeld has already explained BANACH/CANTOR (18.87.0.6); this
will presumably be fixed in the next zone update.  There is also a
conflict:
        HSTG >:         18.87.0.23 = HYPATIA.MIT.EDU
        MIT.EDU zone:   18.87.0.23 = EMMA.MIT.EDU
Both listings have the nickname GLOOP.MIT.EDU, so presumably it's the
same host.  Comments, Ray, anybody?

The TAC is now called TAC.MIT.EDU with nickname MIT-TAC.ARPA because
it makes the automated table merge easier.  The NIC hasn't been
formally requested to make this change (although they are reading this
message) nor will they unless somebody really cares.  It takes a
couple of months and you have to ask the Pentagon's permission.

There are some media lab machines listed in both the MIT.EDU and
MEDIA.MIT.EDU zones.  Henry Holtzman, I asked you about this before
and you didn't respond.  According to the traditional definition, a
host can only have one "primary name".  It is because of this problem
that I haven't started including the HSTMDA file you put together.
        18.85.0.1 = AMTGW.MIT.EDU, AMTGW.MEDIA.MIT.EDU
        18.85.0.3 = ATRP.MIT.EDU, ATRP.MEDIA.MIT.EDU
        18.85.0.6 = EMS.MIT.EDU, EMS.MEDIA.MIT.EDU
        18.85.0.2 = MEDIA-LAB.MIT.EDU, MEDIA-LAB.MEDIA.MIT.EDU
        18.85.0.4 = XEVIOUS.MIT.EDU, XEVIOUS.MEDIA.MIT.EDU
        18.85.0.5 = ZAXXON.MIT.EDU, ZAXXON.MEDIA.MIT.EDU

The nickname 66-056-1.MIT.EDU appears on several hosts:
        18.63.0.13 = MOLD.MIT.EDU
        18.63.0.14 = BACTERIUM.MIT.EDU
        18.63.0.15 = KNOWHOW.MIT.EDU
I think the correct one is MOLD, although I've forgotten how I came to
this conclusion.  Anyway, I made the appropriate change in HSTG a few
days ago, rest of fix is pending zone update by Jeff Schiller now that
he knows about it.

There was some lossage associated with the name SIPBVAX.MIT.EDU (a
nickname for the vax named CHARON).  Problem was that SIPBVAX was a
nickname for CHARON-CHAOS, not CHARON.  So I moved it.  Sorry, RDZ.

That's it for the fatal errors.

The following hosts have no opsys/cpu data listed in the domain system:
        E.CRL.MIT.EDU
        F.CRL.MIT.EDU
        EN.LL.MIT.EDU
        GW.LL.MIT.EDU
        PSAT-IG.LL.MIT.EDU
        WB-ECHO.LL.MIT.EDU
        FILMVIDEO.MEDIA.MIT.EDU
        MORBIUS.MEDIA.MIT.EDU
        QIX.MEDIA.MIT.EDU
        XEVIOUS.MEDIA.MIT.EDU
        ZAXXON.MEDIA.MIT.EDU
Following a suggestion by someone who probably doesn't want credit for
the idea, any such entry will get a default CPU type of "POS" and a
default opsys type of "CTSS" to keep the HOSTS3 compiler from barfing.
If you don't like it, get your entry fixed.

Jeff, I would like to request (for the Iforgethowmany-th time) that
the HINFO record for LCS.MIT.EDU be changed to match the one for XX.
It's confusing people in the outside world (I've gotten several
complaints).  {LCS.MIT.EDU IN HINFO PDP10 TOPS20}.  Thanks.

The MIT.EDU zone still has a lot of entries with primary names
begining with "MIT-".  I'm flushing these from the fixed-up table
automaticly.  In other words, I don't care.  If you do, talk to Jeff
about getting your entry fixed.  The list is too long to include here;
I'll leave it around in the file AI: SRA; MIT- HOSTS.

That's it.  Sorry about the length.

Spencer, Jeff is on Info-Hosts, or was the last time I looked.

KOALA.MIT.EDU and RENOIR.MIT.EDU should be the RLE Lisp machines.
They were there first, and have had their names in the ITS tables for
a long time.  The E40 Athena VAXSTATIONS by the same names should
change their names.  Or that's what it looks like from here, anyway.

As it happens, just this afternoon I wrote some TECO code to grovel
over the output of Mark Lottor's ZONE program (which constructs a
HOSTS.TXT format file by doing domain zone transfers) and produce
something that (theoreticly) can be fed into the HOSTS3 compiler along
with the rest of the tables.  Haven't tried to run it through yet, I
imagine some more conflicts will appear, but if this works out it
should simplify life greatly, since any changes Jeff makes in the
MIT.EDU zone will automaticly be installed in the ITS tables, as will
the LL.MIT.EDU and MEDIA.MIT.EDU zones.

Will send another message if/when I have results of the attempted
merge.

    ...

The machine at 18.87.0.6 changed its name from hilbert to cantor to
eliminate a nickname conflict with hilbert.ai.mit.edu.  It then
changed again to banach because the person getting the machine at
18.87.0.26 (not yet hooked up) wanted the name cantor.  In other
words, ai:syshst;hstg; is correct, bitsy:/hosttable/hstcamp.txt needs
to be updated.  I've notified Jeff Schiller of the changes, so this
should happen eventually.  Despite the fact that the machine answered
with the name hilbert, it does know that its name is banach.

While constructing a new host table for MIT-Multics, I noticed the following
unresolved inconsistencies.  I hope that this is useful to someone.  I am
sending this to both Info-Hosts and directly to Jeff Schiller because I'm not
sure he's on the list.

HOSTS.TXT.582 at SRI-NIC.ARPA and hosttable/hstcamp.txt (17:29 10/20/86) at
BITSY.MIT.EDU and bindtest from HARLEQUIN.MIT.EDU (today) show:

   CANTOR  18.87.0.6

AI:SYSHST;HSTG 46 shows

   BANACH 18.87.0.6
   CANTOR 18.87.0.26

When I telnet to 18.87.0.6, the host gives its name as "hilbert".  When I
telnet to 18.87.0.26, I time out.  According to bindtest, there is no HILBERT
or BANACH in the MIT.EDU domain (although I see a HILBERT in the AI.MIT.EDU
domain).

The MIT-Multics host table will show CANTOR at 18.87.0.6, but somehow I
suspect that mail to that name will fail as long as the host thinks it has a
different name.

----

In hstcamp.txt, KOALA.MIT.EDU appears as a VAXTSTATION at 18.72.0.79.

In AI:SYSHST;HSTG 46, KOALA.MIT.EDU appears as a SYMBOLICS-3600 at CHAOS
15435.

In the MIT-Multics host table, KOALA.MIT.EDU is given to the VAXSTATION, while
the alias KOALA-BEAR on the lisp machine appears as KOALA-BEAR.MIT.EDU.  I
would have less trouble with this conflict if KOALA-BEAR were the primary name
of the lisp machine.

----

In hstcamp.txt, MATISSE.MIT.EDU appears as a VAXSTATION at 18.72.0.214.

In AI:SYSHST;HSTG 46, MATISSE.MIT.EDU appears as a SYMBOLICS-3600 at CHAOS 15416.

In the MIT-Multics host table the lisp machine's address does not appear.

----

In hstcamp.txt, RENOIR.MIT.EDU appears as a VAXSTATION at 18.72.0.108.

In AI:SYSHST;HSTG 46, RENOIR.MIT.EDU appears as a SYMBOLICS-3600 at CHAOS 15415.

Again, in the MIT-Multics host table the lisp machine's address does not
appear.

----

The name 66-056-1 is still on all three of MOLD, BACTERIUM and KNOWHOW, in
that order, in hstcamp.txt.  I suspect that the reason the domain resolver
shows it on KNOWHOW is just that that is the last line claiming the name in
its input file.

Probably OZ just has really old host tables because it munched its
<SYSTEM> directory again and someone copied in the files from the
backup copy of <SYSTEM> they keep on another pack. So if their
automatic updater is running it should fix itself tonight, if
no one does it sooner.

Someone should change the OZ automatic host table updater to
put new host tables in KANSAS:<SYSTEM> whenever it does an
update.

I should have added that the AI nameserver we talk to, prep, DOES

right, but they answer PING packets.)

    From: JMILLER@MIT-OZ

Keep your shirt on.

    The chaos network seems to be completely fouled up with respect
    to where MIT-Vax should be contacted.  In particular,

    From my machine (mephistopheles, 18.26.0.168) Vax is no longer
    accessible.

What address is it trying?  Zermatt and Reagan both have the correct
address.  As does XX and all of the ITS machines (ie, the core systems
in the automatic update mechanism are intact).

    From PREP, Vax can be reached on the internet but not on Chaos.

I don't have an account on prep, somebody else will have to check
this.

    From OZ, Vax cannot be reached at all.

OZ has a totally bogus address for VX, on the wrong subnet (perhaps
the old address from subnet 032, I don't remember).  OZ has some form
of automatic host table installation, so there's no point in my fixing
this because the same program that invented the current bogus host
table will just invent another one tonight.  Fix, somebody?

    I have been told by TPWB that some parts of the chaos net
    (probably some gateways) and OZ have an incorrect address for
    MIT-Vax which is responsible for this.

It might be a routing problem.  Who is TPWB?

    (1) Can someone who knows what he or she is doing please update
    ALL of the relevant host tables about MIT-Vax.

You have no idea how many machines have copies, most of them out of
date.  XX generates all the tables anybody could conceivably need, I
tell everybody about them, but most hosts seem to prefer to go to hell
their own way.  Their priviledge.

    (2) Just for kicks, can that same person try to see if the lisp
    machine name space and the host tables on OZ (at least) are in
    rough agreement.  In particular, I would like to know if the
    Bobcats we are using (Mephistopheles, Zurich, Geneva, Kallisti,
    Murren, Michael, and so forth) are correct everywhere.

Lispms seem ok (the namespace servers, anyway).  OZ is definitely
losing.  I don't know about the bobcats, you'll have to check with a
local systems guru.

    (3) For my own benefit, can you explain how I should add a new
    host to all appropriate tables.  Assume I add only internet
    hosts.

If everybody were getting the automaticly updated (and crosschecked)
tables from XX, the only thing you'd have to do would be add a
namespace object from your Lisp machine (assuming you are adding
something to the LCS-namespace/LCS.MIT.EDU-zone or to the
AI-namespace/AI.MIT.EDU-zone).  As it stands you pretty much have to
nag the system hacker of each machine you use if it isn't being done
to your satisfaction.

    Thank you very much.  Please let me know who, if anyone, is
    planning to work on this.

I suppose I could fix the OZ problems, if nobody else is willing.  But
I'd probably do it by having the nightly batch job just get things
from XX, which seems to bother people (I don't know why).

From my machine (mephistopheles, 18.26.0.168) Vax is no longer
accessible.

From PREP, Vax can be reached on the internet but not on Chaos.

From OZ, Vax cannot be reached at all.

I have been told by TPWB that some parts of the chaos net
(probably some gateways) and OZ have an incorrect address for
MIT-Vax which is responsible for this.

    	The media-lab is now running about 50 machines in its own
    domain, named, .media.mit.edu.  Since JIS is no longer responsible for
    keeping our hosts in the host table, I was wondering if we can get our
    own file in SYSHST so that I can just ftp over a new copy when we
    change things (instead of having to edit someone else's file.

Sounds good to me.  How about AI: SYSHST; HSTAMT > as your magic
filename.  Let me know when you get it set up so I can look it over
and configure it into the table compiler job.

    Re:   Host table errors

    I hope this is the right place to send this...  If it is, I am not on
    this list, so replies will have to be sent directly.

It is.

    The host RTS-6.AI.MIT.EDU has an alias LMI/COLOR in AI:SYSHST;HSTLCS >
    (and AI:SYSHST;HSTMIT >).  The "/" character in this addname seems to
    be in direct violation of RFC 952 and the obsolete RFC 810, which are
    the definitions of the widely used host table source format.

You're right.  I'm surprised the HOSTS3 compiler let it go through but
I guess it allows it because it's an legal character in service names.
Anyway, this was done by some person ignorant of this problem who fed
that as a nickname into the LCS Lisp Machine namespace.  I deleted it,
will percolate through to the AI:SYSNET; tables tonight if nothing
misfires.  Bob and Ziggy, if you can educate the people down where you
live not to do this sort of thing it would help.  Bob, we might also
want to think about making the namespace -> host table dump code check
for this sort of lossage.

    Recent Multics host table maintenance has turned up the following
    inaccuracies and inconsistencies between the real world, the host
    tables in AI:SYSHST; and the Internet host table maintained by
    SRI-NIC.ARPA:

    1) AGAMEMNON.MIT.EDU is shown as 18.72.0.9 in AI:SYSHST;HSTATH >, but
    the NIC thinks it is at 18.71.0.16.  I can communicate with it on
    subnet 72, but the subnet 71 address doesn't respond.  The appropriate
    authority should notify the NIC.

A lot of machines moved from subnet 71 to subnet 72 some time back
(six months?).  Project Athena is somewhat absentminded about telling
the rest of the world about this kind of change.  Eric Starkman
<ens@athena> was the last person I know of willing to put any work
into this, I don't know if he's still there.

    2) A number of hosts are shown in HSTATH as being on subnet 80, but in
    the NIC host table and in a comment in HSTLCS they are shown as being
    on subnet 58.  I can communicate with most of them from Multics at the
    subnet 80 address, but PROMETHEUS doesn't respond to either address:
    APHRODITE 12, APOLLO 10, ARTEMIS 11, ATLAS, 15, CHARON 13 and
    PROMETHEUS 14.  Not only should the NIC be informed, but perhaps the
    (mechanically generated?) comments in HSTLCS should be updated as well.

This looks like a side effect of the one remaining subnet conflict in
the MIT net.  There was a screwup a long time ago and two different
groups started using the same subnet number, one for IP and one for
Chaos.  It's in the process of being cleaned up, I don't know what the
exact status is.  JIS, could you bring us up to date?  Somebody should
tell the NIC about the changed addresses too, once the dust settles.

    3) POLLUX.MIT.EDU is shown in both HSTATH and the NIC host table as
    18.71.0.6, but it appears to actually be at 18.72.0.4 (which was
    obtained from hosttable/hstcamp.txt on BITSY.MIT.EDU).  This is an
    error in AI:SYSHST;HSTATH >, which should be updated as well as telling
    the NIC.

I'll take care of this if ens@athena doesn't resurface soon.

--Rob

PS: I believe that either NIC@NIC or Hostmaster@NIC was on this list
    at one point.  If somebody at the NIC wants to fix the problems
    Spencer has pointed out, I certainly wouldn't object....

The sources in that directory cite RFC 810 as the basis for their
format, but they have been extended to contain CHAOS addresses and
DOMAIN statements with more data than RFC 952 defines.  We extended the
Multics host table software in the past to extract the CHAOS addresses
so our mailer could forward to CHAOS hosts (we were also briefly on the
CHAOS net).

Is it your position that the "/" character in host names is a similar
extension?  Since the "/" is a delimiter with syntactic meaning in
other fields in this file, it is less convenient to change the Multics
software, which uses a uniform lexical analyzer.  Furthermore, it seems
like a bad idea.  There are good reasons why host names are restricted
to such a small character set; for example, operating systems which
attach special meanings to delimiters like "/".

Would the lords of the LCS name space please speak on this matter?

Sometime around 1130 this morning, chaos subnet 025 will be renumberd
to 076.  This is being done to fix the discrepancy between the chaos
and the internet subnet numbers for this network.  The host tables on
AI and XX already have the new addresses for the appropriate hosts.
The hosts affected will be: trillian slarty eddie franky benji hog
u-hog bypass ee-11 cafsw0-7 caf waif bogart and cagney.

On Friday the 29th, chaos subnet 025 will be renumbered.  The new
subnet number will be 076 which corresponds to the decimal internet
subnet number 18.62 which is currently assigned to it.  Chos subnet 025
and the corresponding internet subnet (18.21) will at that point be
reserved for a separate ethernet in building 38, which at this point
is running, but disconnected.

Subject: WARNING -- All hosts become SERVERs, service fields go west

If you don't use the HOSTS3 binary tables or anything generated from
them, you can stop reading this message now.  This is primarily of
interest to PDP-10s and any VAXen that get chaosnet host tables from a
PDP-10.

The HOSTS3 compiler went over the address space limit again today.
The next most expendable thing in the tables was the services list.

Last week I discovered (rather painfully) that there are still ITS and
20X programs which believes the STFSRV bit in the binary HOSTS3 table
(indicating that HOSTS3 thinks a site is a server).  For some time the
only hosts in the tables have been ones that pass this test one way or
another (this is not true for data internal to MIT, but the bulk of
the offending hosts are from the NIC table).  So I added a switch to
the HOSTS3 compiler that tells it to turn on the STFSRV bit for all
entries in the table.  The binary table is now compiled with this
switch turned on, from sources which don't have any service listings.

This cut the size of the compiled HOSTS3.BIN file by about 30%.

The following programs look at the STFSRV bit:

ITS:	(Q)MAIL, probably (Q)SEND.  COMSAT does -not-.
20X:	ARPA-HOSTS, MAIL, SEND, OZ's gateway-FTP.
	MMAILR & MM also affected (via ARPA-HOSTS), except on XX.

There may be others.  I don't think there's any program silly enough
to look at the services field directly.  There is some small loss of
functionality (MAIL will no longer warn you if you try to send mail to
a LispM with no services or to a PC).  Life's rough.  Internet data in
HOSTS3 tables degenerated to the gross kludge state some time ago.

XX:<HOSTS>HSTNIC.TXT and XX:<HOSTS>HSTMIT.TXT will continue to have
service data so that you can look things up if you really care.
HOSTS3 now has its own private input file (XX:<HOSTS>HOSTS3.TXT).

If you think that this is a desperation measure, you're right.

Constructive comments are welcome.  Serious bug reports also.  Flames
about how you can't list out all the services of FOO.RICE.EDU anymore
with the HOST program should be sent to the nearest NUL: device.

	The Symbolics IR link (which used to have an MIT subnet
number back in the days when Symbolics only had a single classs C
number allowed in the routing tables) has turned into a subnet of
the new Symbolics class B net number. That being the case, I have
recycled its MIT subnet number.
	That removes the last traces of Symbolics in the MIT address
space. If the number czar ever gets around to giving Proteon its
class B number, we will also vacate, leaving Harris, LMI and TMI
as the main encroachers on the MIT address space.

This is my fault.  I generated a HOSTS3.BIN file yesterday that didn't
have any service entries in it (because the compiler ran out of
address space again, I couldn't find anything obviously useless in the
pruned table, and services seemed the next most expendable thing).

Unfortunately, ARPA-HOSTS (the thing that conses up the host list for
MM and MMAILR) and FTP and probably other programs look at the
"this-machine-is-a-server" bit (generated from the services field) to
determine whether or not a host is worth talking to.

I punted OZ:<MAIL>ARPA-HOSTS.BIN.738, so mail should work again.  I
will install the latest-but-one HOSTS3.BIN on XX as a new, higher
generation, so that it will propegate to OZ and the ITS machines
tonight.  Speech and Deep-Thought, beware.

In the long run, ARPA-HOSTS and FTP and friends are going to have to
stop believing that server bit.  It is hopelessly unreliable in any
case, because there are a lot of sites that don't furnish correct data
to the NIC.  As things now stand, nothing except TACs and server hosts
even make it into the HOSTS3 table from the NIC table, so there really
isn't much point to pruning the table a second time.  (The TECO
pre-filter has some additional hair to detect things like IBM-PCs that
claim to be server hosts, so it's a little more reliable than just the
services field).

Sorry about this, folks.  I didn't realize that there was anybody who
trusted that server bit enough to use it for anything.

	I advise that at some point in the future the IP address of that
wire be changed to be 071 so that it matches the CHAOS number; i.e. the
wire would become 18.57.0.0. I don't know how many hosts would be affected
by this, but it would finally clear up this problem for good (modulo the
CHAOS wrapped IP subnet, but who cares about that anyway).

Dave Bridgham (dab@borax.lcs.mit.edu) wants chaos subnet 104 allocated
to the campus spine so that he can experiment with getting chaosnet
working on the campus spine.  (18.68.0.0 currently allocated to the
campus spine and corresponds to chaos subnet 104.)

Chaos subnet 104 is currently allocated to the same piece of cable
which currently has 18.58.0.0 on it.  This corresponds with chaos
subnet 72 which is unfortunately already in use by a chaosnet-only
subnet in NE43 which cannot be easily renumbered (it would require
reburning proms).

Chaos subnet 71 octal (18.57.0.0 decimal) was a completely unallocated
subnet.  It is now allocated to the bldg. 1 and bldg. 11 ethernet.

SIPB-11 is currently down (It has apparently been broken for some time
now) which leaves the old chaos subnet 104 completely isolated
(chaosnet wise) for the moment.

Cliff Neuman and I (Tim Shepard) are renumbering the bldg. 11 ethernet
to be Chaos subnet 71 as of now.  I will take care changing the code
for SIPB-11 so that next time it boots it will be on subnet 71 instead
of 104.  Cliff will take care of changing the chaosnet addresses of
CHARON, APHRODITE, and ATHENA to the corresponding subnet 71
addresses.  Note that none of CHARON, APHRODITE, or ATHENA have
chaosnet address in the current chaosnet host tables.

Machine		New Chaosnet address	IP Address
-------		--------------------	----------
CHARON		34415			18.58.0.13
ATHENA		34401			18.58.0.1
APHRODITE	34414			18.58.0.12
SIPB-11		34440		      [ 18.58.0.64 ] (not IP live)

The above address should correspond in the usual manner except that
the subnet number in the chaosnet address appear to correspond to
18.57.0.0 addresses.

In summary:
The bldg. 11 ethernet will carry IP subnet 18.58.0.0 packets (as it
currently does) and chaos subnet 71 packets.

The campus spine will be carry 18.68.0.0 packets (as it currently
does) and will be free to carry chaos packets as subnet 104 if its
maintainers so desire.

Subject: HOSTS3 compiler running again

I got a host table to compile again this morning, by flushing more
stuff from the NIC tables.

I was already flushing any host that didn't speak TCP/SMTP or
TCP/TELNET.  Unfortunately there are a lot of workstations in the
tables that advertise these services.  So the latest crock is to
remove all but the primary name from anything that looks like a
workstation (can't remove the entry entirely because it might be the
machine-type data that's bogus instead of the services data).

So you can't telnet to ISI-POSTEL.ARPA anymore, you have to call it
POSTEL.ISI.EDU.  Life's rough.

I dunno how long this will hold things together.  It only managed to
gc five (twenex) pages of string space.  Sigh.  Of course I can always
add more machine/opsys types to the hit list....

Subject: Name conflicts, table breakage, inconsistancies, version numbers

First the short item.  The HOSTS3 compiler has stopped working again
(undoubtably somebody on the West Coast added another 200 SUN
workstations to the NIC tables).  I'll fix as soon as I decide what
new class of machines to punt.  Files in XX:<HOSTS> will continue to
be updated, but ones in XX:<SYSTEM> will freeze until this is fixed.

Next.  I happened to compare a dump of Jeff's MIT.EDU domain with the
host tables on AI.  I did a number of minor updates to the AI tables.
I also discovered a few questionable items.

	It doesn't appear that the SOA version number is getting
	updated for the MIT.EDU domain or the non-delegated subnets.
	This potentially a serious problem, since it screws anybody
	who wants to do zone transfers.

	Is PARIS.MIT.EDU a VAX-11/750 or a VAX-11/785?
	Is PROMETHEUS.MIT.EDU running UNIX or DOS?
	Is ATRP.MIT.EDU a VAX-11/785 or a VAX-11/750?
	Is SAILOR.MIT.EDU a MASSCOMP or a SUN?
	None of this major, but it'd be nice if it were correct.

	There are some machines in the MIT.EDU domain with names of
	the form MIT-foo.MIT.EDU which are also listed in the AI
	tables (where they get names of the form foo.MIT.EDU):
	CEZANNE, DEGAS, EMS, GOLDILOCKS, TWEETY-PIE, XEVIOUS, ZAXXON.
	Not life or death but it'd be nice if we could agree.

	POLYHYMNIA was listed in both MIT.EDU and LCS.MIT.EDU.  I
	flushed the copy in LCS.MIT.EDU since I have a hard time
	picturing LCS owning a machine in building 66.

	Everybody thinks they own the MIT TAC.  The NIC calls it
	MIT-TAC.ARPA and refuses to change it.  Jeff calls it
	TAC.MIT.EDU, I calls it TAC.LCS.MIT.EDU.  Who cares.

	And lastly, we have two full fledged name conflicts:

	KOALA.MIT.EDU:
		Chaos	15435,  Lispm,		RLE (Speech Ethernet)
		IP 18.72.0.79,  Vaxstation,	Project Athena (E40)

	RENOIR.MIT.EDU:
		Chaos	15415,  Lispm,		RLE (Speech Ethernet)
		IP 18.72.0.108, Vaxstation,	Project Athena (E40)

	I'm pretty sure the Lispms have seniority.  Good thing they
	aren't choosing to talk IP this week.

Watch this space for further cruft.

Here's a reply to a somewhat-antique request for a firing squad.
OZ:<SYSTEM>HOSTS.MIT is still online because the NIGHTLY batch job
copies OZ:<SYSTEM>*.*.* to KANSAS:<SYSTEM>*.*.* every night for safe
keeping.

Maybe we should just set HOST.MIT invisible and see what breaks.  If
that's not a good idea, I can watch the file to see what else, if
anything, tries to open it over a day or two.

I wonder how much other trash is being kept online by this batch job?

Somebody added these two hosts to the AI namespace yesterday and gave
them the same net address (18.26.0.177).  This caused the nightly
table compiler to bomb out (correctly).

I changed GRETCHEN's address to 18.26.0.178.  There doesn't seem to be
anything at all answering that address at the moment, so this
shouldn't break the world too badly.  If I got it backwards, well, fix
it.

I'd contact the culprit directly rather than telling the entire list,
but the culprit didn't bother to fill out any of the nifty namespace
fields that help people figure out where the machines really are.

XX is now generating two new tables as part of the nightly compilation
process.  These are of interest to Unix machines.  They are listings
of the MIT chaosnet, in form suitable for feeding to sendmail as
/etc/chaoshosts (not to be confused with the binary Chaosnet host
table for Unix).

The two files are CHAOSHOSTS.CHAOS-ONLY and CHAOSHOSTS.CHAOS-ALL, both
in XX:<HOSTS>.  The difference between them is that hosts on both
Chaosnet and Internet will be in the second file but not in the first.
If your unix host is only on the Internet you want the first file
(only send mail via chaosnet relay if you can't send via Internet), if
your unix host is only on the chaosnet you want the second file (only
send via Internet relay if you can't send via the Chaosnet).  If your
unix machine is on both it's up to you, depending on which net you
prefer to use.

I made no attempt to filter out non-mail hosts (bridges, etc), since
there is no way to do it without risking removing real hosts as well.
Life's rough.  If a bridge answers to SMTP or MAIL as a contact name
you have problems anyway.

Note that there -are- dots in these files.  Thus sendmail will now be
able to deduce that "OZ.AI.MIT.EDU" is a chaosnet host, if you care.

Source code for the filter is in XX:<HOSTS>CHAOSH.C.  I see no reason
why anybody should ever need to run this themselves, but it's
available if you disagree.

Bug reports to me and/or Info-Hosts, as appropriate.  I don't read
vax-wizards, so don't bother sending things there.

Starting sometime in the next few days the HSTLCS table will start being
generated by Zermatt from the LCS namespace.  Kudos to a certain hacker
(who probably wants to remain unsung) for merging the HSTLCS file and
the namespace.

The preferred method for updating the namespace is to find a Lispm and
use the namespace editor (carefully).  There is also a non-mouse
oriented namespace editor available for people who can't/won't use
Lispms directly.  Contact me if you think you need to use this.  I may
write up some documentation if this method becomes popular.

Most of the name collisions were trivial to deal with.  There is one
that is not.  MUL is in use as a nickname by both MULTICS.MIT.EDU and
MULBERRY.LCS.MIT.EDU.  Due to the respective ages of the machines, the
MULLBERY nickname pretty much has to go (too many people use MUL to mean
MULTICS in mail forwardings).  MULLBERRY hackers, you have been
warned....

Bug reports to the usual places.

Subject: Host tables repaired... for now

Host tables are being generated again.  I frobbed the compiler job to
punt any non-MIT host that doesn't speak TCP/SMTP or TCP/TELNET.  This
shrunk the table size enough for HOSTS3 to generate a table.

This is not a long term fix.  Anybody still using the HOSTS3 binary
file should move to some other lookup mechanism as soon as possible.
Support for this table will probably evaporate as soon as ITS is free
of it.  Discussion invited, on NAMECALLERS@MC.

HOST3C and chaos-only HOSTS2 text files aren't a problem, I can
generate them fairly trivially with TECO.  An MIT-only HOSTS3 file
wouldn't be hard either.  It's the NIC data that's the killer.

Subject: MC <-> MX brain transplant

As of this morning MC and MX have swapped names and IMP ports.  This
manifests itself in the host tables as the two machines exchanging
chaosnet addresses and CPU types.

All Chaosnet machines should obtain new host tables immediately.  The
KL (old MC, new MX) is not long for this world and in fact may have
already bought it as I type this.  The KS (old MX, new MC) is healthy
and is handling the MC mail load.

Host tables are going to be sporadic for the next little while.  The
NIC has increased the table size yet again, and I'm going to have to
figure out some new way to shrink the table back down.  The table
currently installed on XX and the ITSs does not know about any SUN,
IBM-PC, or LispM outside of MIT and Symbolics.  (We needed to punt
something, in a hurry, and these seemed least likely to be missed).

People,

I just turned off the frob that was retrieving new copies of HSTNIC on
MC.  Anybody at MIT who needs the NIC host table should get it from XX
(via anonymous FTP or CFTP).  Please -don't- get it from the NIC (see
enclosed message).  There are two files of interest on XX:

    XX:<HOSTS>HOSTS.NIC is the raw NIC host table; version numbers
    track those at the NIC.

    XX:<SYSTEM>HOSTS.TXT is a merge of the TCP/IP data from the MIT
    tables with the NIC table.  This is the same data that goes into
    the HOSTS3 table, but with all the Chaosnet stuff filtered out.

I enclose the following for people on this list who aren't on TCP-IP.

Re:   The NIC and FTPing host tables

Hi - it's taken me quite a while to draft this message.  However, things
are getting intolerable, and I feel that it's appropriate to broach the
subject.

Quite frankly, we're experiencing tremendous network load from people
(automatically) FTPing the host tables when we release one.  There are
several modes of behaviour which are most offensive:

	o  Many people choose a convenient time, such as midnight.  The
	   consequences are that we get about 10 FTP server jobs running
	   simultaneously.  

	o  Some sites with multiple hosts in close proximity have their
	   hosts get their tables from us, rather than having a single
	   host at the site get it and propagate it.  A sample site had
	   THREE FTP's going from distinct hosts, all getting the host
	   table.

	o  Some sites simply FTP the host table every day, whether it
	   needs it or not.  This is anti-social.

     I feel that a simple and workable solution is for some major sites
(BBN, ISI, Stanford, MIT - this is by no means a request or finger point)
to serve as "host table servers", thus relieving the load on the NIC.
Perhaps a policy implementation modelled after domains is in order.  I do
know that if things don't change, we'll cut back on the frequency of host
table releases from sheer necessity.

     Discussion?

xv.mit.edu supports TCP/FINGER and TCP/TELNET
in addition to TCP/SMTP.  I'd make the change myself,
except I don't really know how, and don't have an account
on xx anyway.  If it matters, perhaps someone can either
make the change or tell me how to.

Subject:  Host tables now automaticly compiled on XX
To: INFO-HOSTS@AI.AI.MIT.EDU
Message-ID: <[AI.AI.MIT.EDU].21858.860327.SRA>

Binary HOSTS3 files for the ITS machines are now being compiled by
XX's nightly batch job.  This means that it should no longer be
necessary to run the HOSTS XFILE script on AI.  HOSTS XFILE is still
around, in case it is needed in an emergency.

XX should probably be considered the cannonical source of binary
HOSTS2 and HOSTS3 files, as well as HOSTS2 format text files.  The
RFC810 format source (text) files will continue to reside on AI for
ease of access.  If you prefer to continue to get binary files from an
ITS, it won't hurt.

If you weren't ever running the HOSTS XFILE script before, this change
shouldn't affect you.

If you want to be added to the (small) list of people who get bug
messages from the XX compiler job if something appears to have gone
seriously wrong, send mail to me.  If you are curious about the
current automated procedure, look in XX: HOSTS;.

The MIT host tables have now been moved to AI.  Update procedures are
as they have been on MC since December.  All the tables live in the
AI: SYSHST; directory.  The INFO-HOSTS mailing list has also moved to
AI.  Nobody should make any further changes to the tables on MC, as
these changes will be lost (really lost, the first time MC has a head
crash, since it will no longer have backup service).

The location change again when we have the other KS-10s up and running
ITS, but at the moment AI is the best choice.

Sorry for whatever confusion this generates, but it seemed better than
keeping the master tables on an unsupported machine.

1) The chaosnet address of ATHENA in the newest HSTMIT is a lie.
   The address listed is really a different project athena machine.
   ENS@ATHENA and I did this because Athena itself is off the chaosnet
   for an indefinite time due to hardware lossage beyond their control.
   So this way mail will get through without having to go via MC, but
   trying to SUPDUP or TELNET to Athena via chaos will lose.  Sorry.

2) The HOSTS3 compiler has run out of address space again, so it won't
   be possible to generate new HOSTS3 binary files until I figure out
   some new class of hosts or nicknames that can be safely pruned from
   HSTNIC.  PDP10s (and vaxen who port HOSTS2.TXT files from XX or OZ)
   beware.

at that time i had in fact changed your entry; until i commented it out
yesterday, this is how it read:
(header-people-incoming @XV)	; req. of Kevin@SLOAN Crowston 1sep85

now, this is what the host table says about the host in question:

the host table thinks XV and SLOAN are the same thing. clearly the host
table, not the Header-People list, is what is confused.  i suggest that you
arrange to have the host table fixed with respect to the Sloan host(s).

Some pinhead put a bunch of EECS hosts into the HSTAI table
(presumably by putting them into Reagan's namespace).  This causes the
host table compiler to barf, since the culprit didn't get all the
names right and there are primary name mismatches.

Host tables will be disfunctional until this is fixed at the source,
since I am not about to start a namespace war with a Lisp Machine.

Chris, you might want to install a filter in Reagan's table dump
program so that it won't propagate this kind of lossage.

without waiting for VX's owners to give me permission (or more
accurately, I timed out while waiting for a useful answer to my
queries).  This change will affect the MIT HOSTS3 and HSTMIT files
(and anything that is generated from them) and the LCS.MIT.EDU domain.
It will *not* affect the NIC tables, so we can change things back
quietly if/when VX's TCP/IP code becomes reliable enough to use for
mail on a regular basis.

Anybody who wants to change this back please talk to me first.  There
are some issues involved that are not readily apparent.

I turned off the code that was generating the names like
MIT-foo.MIT.EDU and foo.MIT.EDU (for hosts that are in some other
domain, ie, AI or LCS).  This was necessary because COMSAT was
completely out of address space and I needed the few K this freed up
just to keep COMSAT running.

This means that (1) host tables will be a little smaller, and that (2)
it is possible that you will be unable to reply to hosts that are
still using these names (nobody should be, but they still linger in
some dark corners).  If you need a table that has all this cruft, you
can get the binary from XX:<SYSTEM>HOSTS3.BIN and the text form of
HSTMIT from XX:<HOSTS>HSTMIT.TXT.

Sorry for the short (one might even say negative) notice, but this was
an emergency fix.

The new tables that have been running on XX on an experimental basis

At CSTACY's request, the tables no longer live in MC: SYSNET; because
the directory got too crowded.  All the text files have been moved to
MC: SYSHST;.  The old versions of the host tables are still present in
SYSNET; on the off chance that we have to back out of this, but they
will be going away soon.  The binary host table of course is still in
SYSBIN;.

There is a little bit of documentation in some of the files in SYSHST;
ask me if you need help, I would much rather have to answer a lot of
silly questions than have to pick up the pieces if somebody breaks all
this.

For those who deleted my last warning on this subject, the new host
table is significantly larger than the old one.  Some programs on your
machine will probably barf and need to be recompiled.  Sorry.

	One other thing we should try and tackle in an organised
fashion is allocation of host numbers on wires. Right now, it's
done by looking through the host tables, which aren't organized in
any useful fashion for this; in addition, some people chose a number,
look to see if anyone has that number in protocol family X, and
don't check to see if anyone is using it in family Y, with the
result that a single host number winds up on two machines, with
all the attendant hassle.
	Shawn keeps files for the LCS Ring and Ether, but they aren't
publicy known about. It would be good if we had files for all the
wires which random people hang new things on somewhere. Any ideas?

Subject: Impending host table format change

I am in the final stages of debugging the various filters, etc to
implement the compartmentalization of the MIT host tables.  For those
who aren't in on this already, HSTMIT is being split up into several
smaller files that map one to one with Internet domains (AI.MIT.EDU,
LCS.MIT.EDU, ATHENA.MIT.EDU, etc).  The new host tables are actually
complete right now, and reside in MC: SYSNET;.  Don't anybody try to
use them yet though (you would have to work very hard to do so
anyway).  There is even a little documentation for them as wants it,
in MC: SYSNET; HSTNEW README.  I'll be testing this for a little while
on XX before mucking with the MC binaries, but that will happen fairly
soon (within two weeks) if nothing major goes wrong.

Anyone who uses the MC host tables at all is hereby warned that
something is almost certain to break on your machine when this change
goes into effect.  The most probably cause is the sheer size of the
new table.  The complete HOSTS3 table (HSTNIC + all the things that
used to be in HSTMIT) will be significantly bigger (how much depends
on what measure you use; the big change is a lot more nicknames for
MIT hosts, some fairly long).  A lot of this is temporary; far too
many existing programs have assumptions about primary hostnames
hardwired into them, so this part of the changeover has to be done in
stages.  Obviously there are a lot of tradeoffs here; questions or
suggestions on this should go to NAMECALLERS@MC rather than all of
INFO-HOSTS.

For now, anybody who edits MC: SYSNET; HSTMIT > should also edit the
appropriate subdomain file.  If you aren't sure what to do, just make
sure to tell me what changes you made and I'll update the appropriate
file.

I will send another message to INFO-HOSTS when I start the actual
changeover on MC, but I wanted to make sure that people had some
advance warning about this.

  . The nicknames MIT-DT and DT have been added.

  . ZARQUON, HACTAR, PRAK, and SLARTIBARTFAST have been commented out
    since they have not been speaking chaos for quite some time and
    the continued existence in the host table as chaos hosts was 
    causing mail queued for them to go undelivered.

Chris: You should consider adding service entries to some of the hosts

As I said, I don't think backing out of the binary was the right thing,
since only the QMAIL program uses that information, it's usually wrong,
and all it does is warn you that the site doesn't claim to support mail.
In fact, the system will send mail to sites which don't claim to support
the service. Since the information has not been used by anyone, I don't
think there has been a great effort to keep it correct.  Backing up to
an older binary means that some valid hosts will be compeltely unknown,
and mail to hosts which have moved will be permanently lost.  Moreover,
QMAIL is an ITS-only program (and hence an ITS bug) but the binary table
is used by some other sites (such as OZ.)

Anyway, I just went in and added the service lists to the dozen or so
sites which I think support mail but which didn't claim to, and created
a new binary table.

I stuck the subnet stuff back into the HSTMIT host table source file
where it has always been; it was an oversight that I forgot to include
it in that one version.

	The switch to the new host tables introduced a slight
problem in that CHAOS only hosts are now using an RFC810 format
instead of the old HOSTS format; the new format allows services
to be listed, and the old one did not. So, all CHAOS only hosts
are now listed without any services! This is causing some programs
(e.g. :MAIL) to complain. We have temporarily backed out of the
binary (*not* the source) of the new tables; someone will have
to go in and edit all the right services onto OZ, PYG, etc.

Anyone needing a table in HOSTS2 format can contact me about a Common-lisp
hack I wrote to produce such things.

(There are still other files required to make a binary host table for
MIT-MC, and you should still not attempt to do that unless you really

The host tables have been slightly rearranged as follows.

SYSNET;HSTNIC - The official Internet host table from the NIC.
		This is retrieved automatically from SRI-NIC each
		evening. No one ever edits this file.
		Hackers note: this file contains domain-style names
		such as "MIT-MC.ARPA" and "PURDUE.EDU", which is
		what everyone is (supposed to be) using now.
		--- This is in RFC810 format (of course.)

SYSNET;HSTMIC - Hosts which are ONLY on the Chaosnet and no other
		networks. This file does NOT include Chaosnet hosts
		which are also on the Internet.
		--- HSTMIC is currently in HOSTS2 format, although it will
		    probably be converted to modified RFC810* soon.

SYSNET;HSTMIB - Hosts which are on both the Internet and the Chaosnet.
		The hosts in here are basically copies of certain HSTNIC
		entries, but with Chaosnet addresses added.
		Note that sites which are Chaosnet-only need HSTMIB also!
		--- HSTMIB is in modified RFC810* format.

SYSNET;HSTMII - Hosts which are only on the Internet but which the NIC
		does not know about.  Since there probably shouldn't be
		any such hosts, this file may disappear in the future.
		The dozen hosts currently listed in here are being contacted
		to see what they think is going on with their host names.
		--- HSTMII is in HOSTS2 format.

* (Modified RFC810 format means that the address field may contain
   keyword network specs.  Example: "HOST : CHAOS 1440 : MIT-MC ...".
   The HOSTS3 compiler understands this format.)

The file SYSNET;HSTMIT is now obsolete and outdated.  Host additions
and changes should be made in the HSTMIC and HSTMIB files instead.
The new files are up to date (from HSTMIT 405 written this evening).

When you edit one of the files, be sure to send a note to everybody at
INFO-HOSTS describing your change.  Do not try to compile the files
for MC; this will be done periodically by an ITS hacker.

Cheers,
Chris

These machines are 3600's in E15, the new Media Lab.  The building
connects to the campus spine, thus is Internet.  There are a couple
Chaos hosts in the building which can (and occasionally do)
communicate, but there is no Chaos connection to the outside world.

It may be in the future that the MINITS bridge ARCMAC-HUB will get
reconstituted in order to connect the ARCMAC Magic-6 hosts to
the real world again.  If so, it might be necessary to boot it from
MIT-EMS, which is also in the building, and if so, MIT-EMS might
then assume MIT-MC's chaos address -- it's easier than cutting a
new rom for ARCMAC-HUB.  For this and other reasons, we chose not
to publicise chaos hackery within E15.  No one outside should ever
see any of it.

Disregarding my previous warnings that MC uses a special host table,
someone on 6/16 installed a bogus host table which broke the mail
system.  (I believe the exact breakage was that the host table forgot
all about any hosts which are on both the Internet and the Chaosnet,

MIT-MC is running an experimental version of our mail system and
certain other programs.  This stuff uses a host table containing
domain-style names and is not generated from the usual files.  

This means if you make any changes, compile and install them, they
will not take effect on MC.  Assuming everything works, at the end of
the week the experimental stuff on MC will become the normal stuff.
The procedure for hacking the host tables will be a little different
at that time.

(Also, I am working on getting a domain name resolver/server going on
MC, and when that's up things will change yet again. Stay tuned!)

For those machines that still need HOSTS2 format files, you can get up
to date versions from SYSTEM:HOSTS2.TXT and SYSTEM:HOSTS2.BIN (source
and binary, respectively) by FTPing to XX and logging in as ANONYMOUS
with any password.  These files get generated automaticly by a batch
job from our HOSTS3 table.  Any host that doesn't fit into the HOSTS2
format is omitted, but otherwise this contains all the hosts and nets
in HSTMIT, HSTSYM, HSTSYI, and HSTNIC.

Right now these are in the old format, with no ".ARPA" on the ends of
Internet hostnames.  When the MC source files change format, so will
these.

Since I no longer need to hand-edit our version of the NIC host

So, if you compile the host tables here, be aware that the NIC table
will be updated without human intervention and inspection.  If the NIC
table is broken or something (bad versions have been known to be
released in the past) you may encounter errors.  You should report
these things to me, and I'll fix them (of course if if you are plenty
damn sure you know what's going on you can fix it yourself.)

Alas, HOST2 and the old "HOSTS >" format is still used by

those adjective is accurate, but I know from personal inspection that

To: INFO-HOSTS @ MIT-MC


In the near future, the format of the HSTNIC and HSTMIT host table
files will be changing as part of the transition to the Internet name
domain system.

The HSTNIC file will reflect the official Internet host table at the
NIC, which these days has hosts with domain names like "MIT-AI.ARPA".  
The hosts also have nicknames like "MIT-AI" (their pre-domain official
global name).

The HSTMIT file will become a HOSTS3 (extended RFC810) format file,
Internet hosts listed in this file will be renamed to correspond to
their names in the HSTNIC file (ie., they will have ".ARPA" tacked on
to them.

Note: Collisions between nicknames in the HSTNIC and HSTMIT file
(e.g., MIT's EDDIE vs. UW's EDDIE) will probably not be solved by
these changes, since their is no real domain name system underneath.

If you are using the HOSTS3 compiler, you can at least compile the new
files.  You may have some trouble with software which thinks it knows
about name domains.  Of course, eventually a great deal of the world
will have to be rewritten to use the name domain stuff in a fully
general way, but that headache is still a little while off.

Also, does anyone still use the old "HOSTS >" format file?  
You probably shouldn't be.  The data in there is far from 
complete or accurate.  Also, since HSTMIT will be in a different
format from HOSTS, updating HOSTS will be painful and people will
probably stop doing it very much (if they are now.)

Please direct any questions and problems to me.

  	.....
      180 nets, 1497 sites, 3174 names; length 21180
      1 "serious" errors, so not writing binary file.
  
  Here are the NIC host table entries for the hosts in question:
  
  HOST : 18.20.41.21, 192.10.41.21 : SCRC-RIVERSIDE : ....
  
  HOST : 18.20.27.21, 18.27.0.21 : MIT-YOSEMITE-SAM,SAM ....
  
  Now, I always thought the 3rd digit in the net 18 scheme was always 0
  for some reason.  In any case, I think HOSTS3 also believes this as it
  seems to be ignoring it.
  
  Since I am not sure who is out of step here, I am sending to all the
  probable parties, in hopes someone will know the right fix.
  
The arpa numeric address standard calls for decimal numbers separated
by dots.  My understanding is that the numbers 18.20.subnet.host are
used at mit to signify those host addresses which support chaos wrapped
internet packets and can unwrap them.  For those hosts, "subnet"
corresponds to the chaos subnet number and "host" to the chaos host
number.  I directly translated chaos octal subnet 033 to decimal number
27. in order to arrive at the addresses for bugs-bunny (18.20.27.17)
and yosemite-sam (18.20.27.21).  Both hosts also have raw internet
packet addresses (18.27.0.17, 18.27.0.21).

The HOSTS3 program must treat the first two numbers of addresses of the
form 18.x as determining the subnet and the last two as determining the
host.  This will work for both addresses of the form 18.x.0.y and
18.20.x.y.

In fact, I think it was an error for me to send the 18.20.27.y addresses
to sri-nic as they do not need to know them.  Those addresses are only
significant for the wrapping gateways around mit.

P.S.
Please send mail to me direct as I am not on any of the hosts mailing lists.

	The problem here is that with the 'new' CHAOS wrapping scheme
in use the third byte is in fact in use. HOSTS3 is incorrect in ignoring
this. Yosemite and Riverside have addresses that are identical except
in the third byte.
	The number of hosts that have that byte non-zero should be very
small; they are the wrapping/unwrapping gateways. The only ones I know
of that are actually running are Bugs, Gross, Riverside and Trillian.
You could probably deleete the offending address for Sam without much
problem.

The HOSTS3 compiler is "fixed".

HOSTS3 hackers: The compiler does not do the sort of dynamic memory
allocation I had assumed. I was therefore able to make some more room in
the ITS version simply by moving where in core the table was being
constructed.  I didn't calculate how much room is left over for new code
or tables, but the increase should hold us for a while.  Of course, we
are racing against the rate of host additions on the various networks in
our table (the Internet, the Chaosnet, etc.)  Hopefully by the time we
run out it will be time to implement a hairy namespace system.  
Won't that be fun!

I installed the latest NIC table, and discovered a new name conflict:
someone else has a SYLVESTER, so I manually removed their nickname.

People should be careful to remember that hosts whose entries appear
in multiple tables must match.  I found several offending entries with
conflicting ARPAnet addresses between the HSTMIT and HSTNIC table,
conflicting host nicknames, and different machine types.  If the
HOSTS3 compiler gets confused and thinks that different machines with
the same name are being talked about in different files, it will throw
away some or all of the information for those hosts.

Mistakes (which I have corrected) in the HSTMIT table had 
removed PREP and TINMAN from the Chaosnet!

Also added SANCHO-PANZA (a 3d floor 3600) to the Chaosnet.

Installed the tables on MC and ML.

No one should compile new host tables on ITS until some
bugs in various system programs are worked out.
The most recent valid files are SYSBIN;HOSTS2 726 and HOSTS3 403.
The ones after that (HOSTS2 LATEST and HOSTS3 LATEST) correspond
to the most recently updated host table source files and required
modifications to the HOSTS3 compiler to produce.  Sadly, they have
pushed the memory limits of assorted system programs and cannot
be installed yet.   I'll send another message when things are
working again.

Subject: New host tables


Well, being rather bored, I decided to teach myself to get new host
tables from the NIC and compile host tables on MC.

I did the following things.  I think they are right, but would
appreciate any suggestions for a better way:

   - Ran CSTACY;HOSTS to retrieve the lastest NIC table

   - Did :XFILE SYSENG;HOSTS XFILE to create the tables

   - Got the following cruft printed out:

Nickname WARD for Internet site WASHINGTON is also a CHAOS host, ignored.
Nickname ROCKY for Internet site CU-ROBOTICS is also a CHAOS host, ignored.
Nickname MERLIN for Internet site PURDUE-MERLIN is also a CHAOS host, ignored.
Nickname LARRY for Internet site UW-BLUECHIP is also a CHAOS host, ignored.
Nickname FORD for Internet site FORD1 is also a CHAOS host, ignored.
Nickname EDDIE for Internet site UW-EDDIE is also a CHAOS host, ignored.
Nickname COYOTE for Internet site SU-COYOTE is also a CHAOS host, ignored.
Nickname ARTHUR for Internet site PURDUE is also a CHAOS host, ignored.

    - Went back in, and hand edited out the DUPS from the NIC table,
      and wrote back out the table to the same version (349).

    - Compiled the table again, noticing that the NIC had now made
      MIT-NEWTOWNE-VARIETY the primary name for MIT-FLA.  Of course
      HSTMIT still had MIT-FLA as the primary name, so HOSTS2 bitched.

    - Edited HSTMIT to make it consistent with HSTNIC.

    - Compiled the tables one last time.

I wasn't sure if ALL the dup nicknames usually got edited out, but it
seemed like the right thing for local use.

Anyway, if I did something wrong, someone can fix it, and please let
me know so I don't do it again.

There are a few easy ways out of this mess (some easier than
others).

1.  Somebody add mit-athena, and athena, as nicknames for charon,
unless there's some special reason why that shouldn't be done.

2.  Steve, if you were using MM, and did 

to: "mit-athena!tony"@mit-eddie,

I believe MM would have converted it properly for MMAILR to use it.
(Is that so, Gail?  If not, we have a serious problem here.)  If you
didn't, you don't have to put quotes around the foreign address,
because the quotes are there so MM won't interpret the ! as a comment.
(Correct me again Gail if I'm wrong.)

3. In general, you should try to find other means besides using UUCP
to send mail which you want delivered in a hurry.  (It looked from the
message as if you expected it to get there immediately.)  UUCP mail is
more than a magnitude of order slower than CHAOS mail, which means
that it probably would have taken a day or so for your message to get
to mit-athena (if it ever got there -- you'd be surprised at how often
UUCP mail gets lost).  I don't see any reason why they are not
accepting chaos mail anyhow, seeing as they're on the chaosnet, that
sort of goes along with the territory.

	ftp.  Really, it's user-interface brain death.  You see it used

	that the default used to be adequate for any file transfer, and who
	really looks at spastic program printout anyway....
    Someone changed the machine type in the host table of all the pdp10s from
    "PDP10" to imaginative things like "DEC-10", "DEC-1080".  Thus FTP can no
    longer tell when a machine is a pdp10.  Probably this was imposed on us by
    the NIC.  Someone should give FTP a list of all the known pdp10 machines or
    all the known pdp10 operating systems, replacing the present code in the
    NHOSTN routine.

    Presumably this is an attempt to get us all to switch to Unix.

I just changed FTP to think that things which run ITS, WAITS, TOPS10,
TOPS20, TENEX, and FOONEX are PDP-10s.

Subject:  Project Athena Vaxen & Large Chaos subnet numbers
To: INFO-HOSTS @ MIT-MC

Two Project Athena Vaxen have been added to HSTMIT table as Chaos only
hosts.

They are MIT-CHARON, Chaos address 042015 and MIT-APOLLO, Chaos address
042013.  APOLLO is not actually on the chaos net yet, but probably will
be in time, along with another dozen or two Project Athena machines.

Some of you may have noticed that these machines are on Chaos subnet
104o.  This subnet is 11d higher than any previously active subnet on the
MIT-Chaos net.  This is due to various places which have reserved subnets
not yet operational or connected to the main MIT Chaos net.

This subnet is not reachable by a large number of Chaosnet hosts due to
their routing tables being too small.  I have fixed the bridges
MIT-INFINITE and MIT-BYPASS, which merely needed recompiling.  However,
there are other bridges and hosts that should have their routing tables
enlarged.  In partcular the front end 11 for every 20 on campus, MIT-VAX
and I imagine many other Unix hosts.

Note that Chaos subnet 104o=68d, whereas the Athena machines all think
they are on Internet subnet 18.58.xx.xx.  I understand that there was once
an attempt to maintain a correspondence between MIT internet subnet and
Chaos subnet numbers.  Apparently Project Athena was originally assigned a
set of subnets starting at 58d, but when these were claimed by groups, no
one bothered informing the Athena staff.  This doesn't represent any
problem yet, if it ever will, as there is no Internet link from the Athena
machines to the rest of the Internet.

I would also make a plea that if people increase their routing table sizes
they go straight to 122d (172o).  This is the number of subnet entries
that will fit in the maximum size routing packet.  It's real hard to
figure out that no one can talk to your subnet because your routing
packets are being ignored.

	SYMBOLICS-3600 is the way SCRC wanted their hosts listed.  I guess
	that is the new convention...

When I first had SCRC-Peace added to the NIC host table, I told them
that it was a Symbolics 3600.  They assigned the machine type
"SYMBOLICS-3600" to it.  I followed their lead from then on.

HOSTS 724 and HSTMIT 170 add Chaos sites MIT-EMS (6401), MIT-HAYDN (6402),
and MIT-WAIF (6420). Additionally, MIT-INFINITE (bldg 8 bridge) has grown
a new address 6410.

Subnet vultures will note that this constitutes the (re)activation of
subnet 15 as part of the Big Picture.

    ftp.  Really, it's user-interface brain death.  You see it used
    to do-the-right-thing between pdp10s and now it doesn't.  We expected
    without thinking that it would.  (I think that was it anyway;  transfering
    in ascii rather than 36bit).  It's not like it lies or anythign, but
    that the default used to be adequate for any file transfer, and who
    really looks at spastic program printout anyway....
Someone changed the machine type in the host table of all the pdp10s from
"PDP10" to imaginative things like "DEC-10", "DEC-1080".  Thus FTP can no
longer tell when a machine is a pdp10.  Probably this was imposed on us by
the NIC.  Someone should give FTP a list of all the known pdp10 machines or
all the known pdp10 operating systems, replacing the present code in the
NHOSTN routine.

Presumably this is an attempt to get us all to switch to Unix.
