libtrm is the library for fancy terminal stuff.  currently, libtrm
only contains trmcap, the package for slurping in termcap entries,
returning requested portions, creating cursor movement strings, and so
forth.  for full trmcap documentation see termcap(3X); for termcap
entry documentation see termcap(5);

trmcap contains these functions:

    int tgetent(bp, name);	get entry for terminal name into buf bp
    int tgetnum(cap);		get the numeric value of capability cap
    int tgetflag(cap);		returns 1 if the given cap is present, else 0
    char *tgetstr(cap, area);	return string value for capability cap
    char *tgoto(cm, h, v);	return cursor addressing string to get to h,v
    void tputs(string, nlines, outfun);
				output string with padding.  see man page.
    char *tparam(string, outstring, len, arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3);
				expand termcap entry into outstring

hideous global constants which trmcap defines:

    short ospeed;		output speed of the terminal
    char PC;			character to use for padding to terminal?
    char *BC;			pointer to "bc" capability in termcap entry
    char *UP;			pointer to "up" capability in termcap entry
