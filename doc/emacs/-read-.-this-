The files TS > are the dumped copies of EMACS.  There need only be two of them.
The file TECMAC <number> is the current versions of TECMAC for the
  TECO version <number>.  Please do not delete any of them.
Files TCM<number> <number> are dumped versions of TECMAC.  Please
  keep 2 for each distinct FN1.
Finally, the files [PURE] <number> are the sharable copies of the
  EMACS library.  THEY MUST NOT BE REAPED UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT USES THEM.
  Each TCMnnn file, each TECMAC nnn file, and each TS nn file, uses
  the [PURE] file which is the most recent [PURE] file written
  before it (the TS, TECMAC or TCMnnn file) was written.
  If you don't understand this, don't delete ANY [PURE] file.
  I (RMS) take good care of flushing any garbage I can find in
  this directory, so you need not attend to it.
