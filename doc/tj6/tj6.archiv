WBA 2/4/78  version 26

BUFSIZ increased from 200 to 600 (determines free storage)

GLS 12/26/77  version 25

[1] The maximum number of fonts has been raised
    from six to ten.  Thus any decimal digit may
    follow a ^F character.
[2] One may write ^F*, which means pop the font
    to the state before the last ^Fn command.
    There is a ring buffer for this, so that
    ^Fn ... ^F* may be nested about 64 deep.
[3] .LTRSPC 0 prevents TJ6 from putting extra
    space between letters of a word when adjusting
    for the XGP.  .LTRSPC 1 (the default) reenables
    this.
[4] .XGP used to be ignored if the output device
    was not DSK.  Now it is ignored only if the
    output device is LPT or TPL.

JDC  5/16/75   New NNTJ6 (and NTJ6) fixes some  bugs.  New features:
.SQUISH  causes ;SQUISH to appear on XGP command page
.ASP	absolute space.  Like .SPACE, but leaves same amount of space when
	 SINGLE or DOUBLE spacing.
.ABLOCK	absolute BLOCK.  Like .BLOCK, but not dependent on SINGLE or DOUBLE.
 (control G)	new in-text command equivalent to .GENNUM 1 1.
TJ6 will soon be identical to NNTJ6 and NTJ6.
Reminder:  I'm still ignoring bug reports without source files, and all requests for
   features.

2/25/75
NTJ6_NNTJ6.7 NNTJ6_NNTJ6.8
NNTJ6.8 fixes some bugs: .HYPHEN, :JCL mumble <cr>P, etc.
Also, as promised, eliminates commands in favor of in-text characters, or command switches:
BSCORE	ESCORE	HDFONT	SELECT	SF	DATE	FNAME	CONTEN
							/C

1/75
Because of some particularly bad default conditions in NNTJ6.6,
NNTJ6 has been unfrozen and refrozen, and NNTJ6.7 has the following changes:
The default size of a tab and spacing unit has been changed to
	the largest character in font 0. The new command TABFNT
	can be used to change this.
Tabs and spaces which cause breaks will never be compacted.
TABINC has gone away.
Three command names have been changed to things that can be remembered:
	PGN to NOHEAD
	PGNRGH to HEADPW
	RL to RTW
BLUP and BLDOWN are flushed in favor of SCRIPT.
There are 8 GENNUM counters.
/X makes the output default 2nd file name XGP.
NNTJ6.7 is not restartable and kills itself after one file.
It is one block smaller the block which was flushed was unpure. (Total 6 blocks,
	3 pure.)  This is part of President Ford's WIN program.

For details, XGP TJ6;ORDER MEMO, or :print TJ6;TJ6 ORDER.
This file has a writeup on spaces and tabs, and explains error mesages.

11/27/74  JDC

18 November, 1974
There are many changes, some incompatible, in NNTJ6.6.
The complete list of NNTJ6 commands is TJ6;TJ6 ORDER.  (XGP Version -- TJ6;ORDER MEMO)

1) Contents:  TJ6 when asked to do a table of contents,
outputs a file which is suitable for input to TJ6, and is a series of .SPREAD
commands, eg,
	.Spread
	/First Section Heading//1/
	.Spread
	/Second section//2/
etc.  TJ6 will use a / as the field seperator in writing .SPREADs,
unless this is changed with the .STERM command, which takes one character
as an argument (like .DUMMY).
The preferred method of causing a table of contents to be produced is to
type /C in the command line. If one uses the .CONTEN command instead,
it must appear before any text.  (This command may go away soon.)
The default output 2nd filename when /C is typed is CONTEN instead of MEMO.

2)  Tabs on the XGP will try to align so that things which line up in TECO will
also line up in TJ6.  In order to do this, tabstops will be equal to
8 * the width of the largest character read in all fonts.
Units for .INDENT, .TW, .RLINE, etc., and spaces at the
beginning of a line will all be 1/8th of a tabstop wide.
To change this, (but risk not having TJ6 and TECO be isomorphic with
respect to tab alignment,) use:
	.TABINC <number> sets width of a tabstop in inches
	.SPW <number> sets the width of the spacing unit in XGP dots (and a tabstop
is 8 times as wide).

3)  (Control Q) is now the default quoting character.

4)  (Control D) and (Control N) are two new in-text command
characters which respectively insert the date and file name into the text
(like .DATE and .FNAME).  The date is now of the form "November 78, 2965"
instead of MM/DD/YY.  The in text characters should be preferred to the
commands as the latter may go away.

5) Redundant carriage returns will be retained in the output text.  To turn this
off use:
	.CRCOMP compacts carriage returns.  The opposite is:
	.CRRETA retains carriage rturns.

6) The size of a .BLOCK implied by a .SECT can be controlled with
	.SBLOCK <number>

7) Other new commands:
.CRBR all carriage returns break.
.CRSP carriage returns in fill and adjust mode are like spaces (default).
.SPBR leading spaces and tabs cause a break (default).
.SPSP they don't break.
.SPCOMP compact spaces in FILL and ADJUST modes.
.SPRETA retain spaces.  These last two commands are affected by
	.FILL, .ADJUST, and .HALFAD, the first two of which do an automatic
	.SPRETA, and the latter two do a .SPCOMP.
Note that the combination of .SPSP and .SPCOMP will allow input text that
has leading spaces or tabs to be treated as though those tabs or spaces weren't there.

8) The .TABSET command has died an early death.

9) -- (dash) will not be broken between the hyphens.

10) Font files which don't open will have the ERR device message printed.

11) The commands which should appear before text in the input file:
.XGP, .FONT, and .CONTEN, will have an error message printed if they
appear after text.

12) PGNRGH will now align headings on both sides with the page boundaries.

13) The p"pages" message printed by TJ6 is now the actual number of
pages printed, rather than the last page number.

14) Rubouts in the command string work better from displays.

15) NNTJ6.6 is now down to 7 core blocks (but just barely).  This is one less than NNT6.5,
and in spite gross additions (like variable width hackery) is only one greater than TJ6.
Its small size (and shared pages) is one of the main reasons that TJ6 runs
so much quicker than PUB (which is 54 blocks as soon as you type PUB^K, and gets
bigger faster than Alice in Wonderland.)  I aim to keep TJ6 small, and I therefore declare
it frozen, with the possibility of removing some commands.
The commands likely to be flushed, which all can be effected some other way, are:
	.FNAME (use )
	.DATE  (use )
	.SELECT and .SF (use )
	.BSCORE (use )
	.ESCORE (use )
	One of .BLUP .BLDOWN
	.HDFONT (use )
Also TJ6 may kill itself after printing one file.

16) I need source files in order to find bugs!!!
A bug which looks easy to recreate often depends on
som special circumstance in the source file, and is next to impossible for me to
duplicate.

            TJ6 Recent Changes                   1_             NNTJ6 3 -- 24 June, 1974

                                        or, T_h_e_ _N_e_w_ _R_e_g_i_m_e_

            There are important new changes to the text justifier.  These changes are
            incorporated in NNTJ6.  After a while, NNTJ6 will become the standard TJ6,
            so use NNTJ6 and help get the bugs out.

            Most of these changes are designed to straighten out the mess which is the
            insides of TJ6. Changes visible to the user are:

            NNTJ6 is half p_u_r_e_ _c_o_d_e_.  Hopefully this will speed it up in certain
            circumstances.

            It has some n_e_w_ _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s_:
            ._P_W_I_N_C_H_ _n_ -- sets paper width (.PAPERW) in tenths of an inch.  E.G., 
                     .PWINCH 8.5 sets the physical paper width to 8.5 inches.
            ._T_W_I_N_C_H_ _n_ -- sets text width (.LINE) 
            ._P_L_I_N_C_H_ _n_ -- paper length (.PSIZE) 
            ._T_L_I_N_C_H_ _n_ -- text length (.PAPER) 
            ._S_I_N_C_H_ _a_,_b_,_c_,_d_,_e_ -- sets paper width, text width, paper length, text
                    length, and left margin  in inches respectively to a,b,c,d, and e.
                    E.G., 
                     .SINCH 8.5,6.,11,8.0,1.5 sets the physical paper size to 8 1/2x11,
                    the text size to 6x8, and left margin to 1 1/2 inches.

            ._F_I_N_C_H_ _n_ -- sets figure size in inches.
                     ._F_I_G_U_R_E_ _n_ nows treats its argument as an absolute number of lines
                    (irregardless of whether you are single or double spacing).

            ._F_O_N_T_ _n_ _F_i_l_e_ _N_a_m_e_ -- associates font n with the appropriate font file.
                    This is used to set font height and width, for use by various size
                    commands, and to set the font name for the XGPLPT command page.
                     .FONT 1 LGI makes font 1 FONTS;LGI KST.
                    (This command actually causes the entire font to be read in and
                    groveled over, so it takes a while to execute.  The only legal
                    device names are AI and DSK.) 

            ._V_S_P_ -- sets interline space. Units are XGP raster dots, 1/192nds of an
                    inch.  (Default is 6.) 

            ._H_V_W_ _a_,_b_,_c_ -- sets the height of font 0, VSP, and width of a space in font
                    0 respectively to a, b, and c.  The defaults are 25, 6, and 16 for
                    the XGP, and 24, 6, and 19 for non-XGP.  These data are used by the
                    commands which set size in inches.  .HVW is a quicker way of
                    reading in this information than .FONT.

            X_G_P_L_P_T_ _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_ _p_a_g_e_ -- If TJ6 thinks it's outputting to the XGP, (i.e.,
                    output device is DSK: and there was either a /X in the command line
                    or a .XGP command,) it automatically outputs a page of XGPLPT
                    commands:

                    ;SKIP 1
                    To prevent TJ6 from doing this, use:
            ._N_O_S_P_E_C_ -- turns off automatic output of XGPLPT commands.

            ._U_L_F_O_N_T_ _n_ -- causes printing in font n to be underlined if output is not to
                    the XGP.  Default is .ULFONT 1.  (This is helpful if the ulfont is
                    italicized.)  (To turn off, make n <0 or >3.) 

            _ _(_c_o_n_t_r_o_l_ _Y_)_ -- in text command character which begins underscore.
            _ _(_c_o_n_t_r_o_l_ _X_)_ -- in text command character which ends underscore.
            Note that underscoring is treated differently by TJ6 and the XGP than
                    backspacing and overstriking with underbars.  For underscoring, TJ6
                    outputs special XGP underscore commands.  For overstriking, TJ6
                    backspaces and overstrikes.  (Complicated, huh?) For most fonts,
                    the _ character is defined to look like underscoring.  For a couple
                    it isn't.  So if you mean underscore, do it, and if you mean
                    overstruck _, do that.  (Backspacing and overstriking of all
                    characters once again win in .NOFILL mode.) 

            All the in text command characters should now work on centered, spread,
                    etc.,  lines, and in the header.  Those in-text characters which
                    make sense to non-XGP devices are:  (control Y), begin underscore;
                     (control X), end underscore; and  (control F), font switch,
                    which makes sense because of .ULFONT). Other in-text commands are
                    ignored if not to the XGP.

            H_i_d_d_e_n_ _h_y_p_h_e_n_s_ work!

            ^^_C_ _(_c_o_n_t_r_o_l_ _C_)_ is now read by TJ6 like any other input character, but TECO
                    makes these difficult to insert.  Also they are not typed out in
                    block mode .IOTs to teletypes, due to a system "feature".

            Characters which have been quoted (with the quoting character), will be
                    printed on the XGP in "normal" mode.  E.G., quoting character
                    followed by a backspace will print as lambda, rather than
                    backspace.  To turn this off use:
                     ._N_O_R_M_A_L_ _n_ -- if no argument or n=0, turns off "normalization" of
                    quoted characters to the XGP, otherwise turns it on.  This command
                    does not break.

            F_L_U_S_H_E_D_ _C_O_M_M_A_N_D_S_ 
            The following commands have been noops for a while, and are now gone:
                     .BSPDIR (Back spacing is always direct.)

            ._S_E_C_T_ -- now does a .BLOCK 2, so that a section title will not be the last
                    line on an output page.

            ._T_R_A_N_S_ -- now works on input instead of output.  All text characters may be
                    translated.  Command line characters are not translated.  (The
                    translation occurs before the test for in-text command characters,
                    therefore, 
                     .TRANS \^F will cause \_ to act as an in-text font switching
                    character.) 

            ._X_G_P_ and /_X_ -- now are equivalent.  If output is to DSK, they: do a .SINCH
                    8.5,6,11,8; a .HVW 25,6,16;  and try to output an XGPLPT command
                    page.

            Handling of s_p_a_c_e_s_, ?_ _._ _!_, and ;_ _:_ has been changed.  In .NOFILL mode, they
                    continue to get no special treatment.  In fill mode, they have two
                    spaces inserted afterwards only if followed by a carriage return or
                    line feed.  There is a n_e_w_ _m_o_d_e_, .HALFAD, in which the text is
                    filled, but not adjusted, and in which spaces and ?_._!_:_;_ are treated
                    the same as in .ADJUST mode.  The gist of this treatment is that
                    two spaces will be inserted after ._!_?_:_;_ at the end of a clause or
                    sentence, and that more than one space or tab in a row (except at
                    the start of an input line,) is treated like one space.  NNTJ6's
                    algorithm for determining the end of sentence or clause is:
                                               A_B_._C_D_
                    The . is always treated like the end of a clause or sentence if C
                    is a carriage return or line feed;  otherwise, This is n_o_t_ the end
                    of a sentence or clause if:
                    1 B is a number;
                    2 B is a letter and A is a space, tab, or one of ._!_?_;_:_;
                    3 C is not a space, tab, carriage return, line feed, or one or more
                    of the following:  )_"_'_]_;
                    4 C is one or more of )_"_'_]_, and D is not a space, tab, carriage
                    return, or line feed.
                    (In cases like A_B_._)_ _, the spaces are inserted after the )_.) 
                    If you don't like the special treatment of some of these
                    characters, turn one off with:
            ._P_E_R_I_O_D_ _n_ _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_ -- which turns off special treatment of c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_ if
                    n=0, otherwise, turns it on.
                    ._P_E_R_I_O_D_ with no argument, still turns off special treatment of all
                    of ._!_?_;_:_.

            M_E_M_O_ is now the default output name instead of (MEMO).

            the probablity of my looking at any bug complaint, without an example of

            In the immediate future, I shall concentrate on continuing to straighten
            out the inside of TJ6, and I am unwilling to put in new features.  Please
            don't waste my time by asking for a .UPSIDEDOWN command, or whatever's your
            penchant.  However, if you feel you absolutely must have a new feature, you
            may go about it as follows:
            1)  Obtain three "TJ6 Suggested Improvement Forms" 
                    from Suzin Jabari.  (These will be available in a couple of weeks.)
            2)  Fill them out, and give one copy to Marvin, one copy to Berthold, and
                    one copy to me.
            Your request will be carefully filed.
