Abstract
.adjust
This memo, intended as both a reference and user's manual describes
the text-justifying program TJ6, which compiles a neat output document
from a sloppy input manuscript.
TJ6 can justify and fill text; automatically number pages and figures;
control page format and indentation; underline, superscript, and
subscript; print a table of contents; etc.
