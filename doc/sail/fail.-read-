This is the procedure for creating a new FAIL under ITS:

1) Assemble:  do FAIL^K then SAIL;FAIL NREL_SAIL;FAIL<cr>.

2) Load: rename FAIL REL to FAIL OREL, then do
STINK^K and MSAIL;FAIL LOADER@, making sure first that you do
not have a job named FAIL.
This will complete and return to DDT quietly, so type a rubout
(whereby you will see by DDT's response when STINK is finished).

3) Set up for simulation by DECUUO:
Then do ..STAR/ and deposit the RH of the contents in 120 (leave
the LH of 120 zero).  Then merge in a bootstrap by means of
1L DECSYS;DECBOT BIN
and deposit 1000 in location 56 to set the simulation switches.

4) Finally, dump with Y as SAIL;FAIL BIN (make sure to rename the old
FAIL BIN!) or anything else.
