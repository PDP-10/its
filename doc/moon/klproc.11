I.T.S. CRASH PROCEDURE
.skip 500 mills
Find the CRASH LOG book and record the particulars, including
the date, the time, your name, the message that was printed
on the system console, and anything else that seems relevant.

If the message on the system console is anything other than "KL10 HALTED..."
don't do anything; get a system hacker.  If you don't understand the
rest of these directions, don't do anything.  Get a system hacker
or leave it down.

If the message was "KL10 HALTED...",
type DDT <return>.  The console should type out
a greater than, period, carriage return.  You are now in exec DDT.
Type <letter A> <equals> to get the symbol table.  Type the PC number that was
in the KL10 HALTED message and an underscore to get the symbolic location
of the crash.  Determine the cause of the crash.  If you don't know
how to do this, then don't worry about it.

If you think the crashed system needs to be saved so a system hacker
can look at it, type <altmode> Y and wait for a space to echo.
Then type CRASH <space> 3name1 <return>, where 3name1 is a suitable
name based on where it halted.  You can use CTRL/F to list the directory
and find what names have already been used.

Now execute the 3Warm Boot1 procedure.  If it fails, try a 3Cold Boot1.

PROCEDURE FOR BRINGING DOWN I.T.S.
.skip 500 mills
Find a console and type control-Z.  ITS responds with its greeting.
Type :LOGIN DEC <return> (if you are from DEC); otherwise login with your normal
user name.  Note that this command begins with a colon.
Alternatively, borrow the console of a user who is already
logged in.

Type :LOCK <return>.  Type 5DOWN.  No carriage return is necessary.
Answer the questions.  (The "5" is the number of minutes before shutdown.)

ITS will now type a "going down" message on all consoles.  If
all users, including you, log out (by typing control-Z and :LOGOUT) the system will go down right away.

After it types "ITS NOT IN OPERATION" the lights on the memories will
blink for a while, then the system console will type a carriage return.
You are now in exec DDT.  Hitting break then control-C will get you to KLDCP.

COLD BOOT PROCEDURE
.skip 500 mills
This procedure is to be used to restart ITS after running
diagnostics or the DEC system, after a power failure,
or after the warm boot procedure has been tried and found wanting.

Make plenty damn sure the right disks are mounted.  Currently
"ITS PK0 #0 + KLDCP" should be on unit 0, not write-protected,
"ITS PK1 #1" should be on unit 1, not write-protected, and 
"ITS SECONDARY PACK #13" should be on unit 2, not write-protected.

If there was a power failure, some circuit breakers may need to be reset.
Push stop on disk unit 0, wait until it stops spinning, then
open the back and turn "CB1" (lower right corner) off and on.
Then push start.  If there are no lights lit on the disk DF10C
(second box from the left on the right-hand side), open its rear door
and reset the white circuit breaker near the bottom of the inside
of the door.  Check the
3fault1 light on the KL10.  If it is on, open the rear door
of the right-hand KL10 cabinet and check the fault lights on
the power control.  (Column of LED's near the bottom of the cabinet.)

Push the DISK button on the KL10, to reload KLDCP.
If it doesn't work, check the top of the ENABLE switch is pushed in.
If this fails, try doing the preceding paragraph.
If it wins, "DECSYSTEM10 DIAGNOSTIC CONSOLE" will be typed out on
the system console.

Type RP0 <return>.

Type J <space> KLINIT <return>.
Wait for a <greater than> <period> prompt.  (Several lines will be typed
out first.)  If a "2-way interleave" note is on the console, use KLINI2
instead of KLINIT.

If, while running KLINIT you get a message such as ?10 ERR ADR=nn COR=nn ACT=nn
there is probably a failing memory.  Get help.

Type J <space> NTSDDT <return>.  If this responds with
I NTSDDT <return> <return>, then
you are winning and exec ddt is now running.  Otherwise, get a system
hacker.

Reload the I/O pdp11 by typing <altmode> L BOOT11 <return>, wait for
blank line, type <altmode> G, wait for blank line.  If you get file not
found (FNF), try <altmode> L <period> <semicolon> BOOT11 <return>.

Continue with the warm boot procedure.

WARM BOOT PROCEDURE
.break skip 500 mills
Type <altmode> L 3sys1 <return>, where 3sys1 is the name
of the current system, which will be found on a punch card on the LA36.
Type <altmode> G.  It should reply "SALVAGER.nnn", then
after a half minute it should say "ITS IN OPERATION".
If it says "*** ERROR SYSTEM MAY NOT BE BROUGHT UP ***",
or any other ominous error message, do not attempt
to do anything further.  Get a system hacker.

If it types "ITS IN OPERATION" but then doesn't seem to do anything
further, you may need to reload the I/O pdp11.  See the Cold Boot procedure.

Usually it types out "IT IS NOW ..." and the date and time.  If the
.<<fuck you PUB, you eat shit>>
machine has been powered off, it will ask you to enter the date and time.
If this happens, or the date or time it prints is way off (shouldn't happen),
you can set the time by going to the Data Point and hitting control Z.
When you get the greeting, type :LOGIN <space> PDSET <return>.
Type the date in the form "3yymmdd1D".  Type the time in the form
"3hhmmss1T".  Type <exclamation point> <period>.  Type Q <period>.
Note that the system console will type out the date, time, and day of
the week.  Be sure to check this to verify that you got it right.
