[1] WHEN RUNNING MEMORY DIAGNOSTICS, USE 'PE' COMMAND
TO TURN OFF PARITY CHECKING.
[2] WHEN RUNNING ANY DIAGNOSTIC, EVEN THE 'DG' SERIES,
YOU HAVE TO 'P U.RAM'.
[3] WHEN RUNNING DDDFA THE CHANNEL HAS TO BE IN KA
 MODE.  THIS IS A BUG IN THE PROGRAM.
[4] WHEN POWERING THE SYSTEM ON, THE LAST THING TO BE
TURNED ON HAS TO BE RP04 #0.  OTHERWISE THE PDP11 CAN'T
ACCESS THAT DISK FOR SOME REASON.
