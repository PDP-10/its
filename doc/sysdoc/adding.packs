HOW TO ADD A DISK PACK TO ITS

Change the configuration in SALV or NSALV.  FIRSPK and LASTPK defines
the range of packs for SALV to check and ITS to mount.

Change the definition of NQS in ITS.  It should match the number of
packs mounted.

Run MARK in SALV to mark the packs.  The unit number is the disk
drive, and the pack number is what ITS and SALV use.

Use UCOP in SALV to update the MFD and UFDs on the fresh pack with
information from a pack already in use.
