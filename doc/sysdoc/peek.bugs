    In the case of the DQ device screw, I don't really understand why PEEK
    PCLSRing the -server- would cause any kind of deadlock to be broken.

Not that surprising.  Remember that DQ: is a very strange file.  In
particular, see the code that uses register Y in OUTPUT and BOJINT to
avoid hanging forever at the SIOT in OUTPUT.  I would not be surprised
if that code was intimately involved in this bug, I doubt anybody has
ever tried to make a JOB device do anything this twisted before.

I just found two obvious places in PEEK that would cause a job to get
PCLSR'd.  

The first would PCLSR any job that PEEK suspected might be a MUDDLE job (it
had some test involving the contents of the job's accumulators).  Despite
the comment that threatened to "BREAK THE NECK OF THE ASSHOLE WHO REMOVES
ANY CODE HERE WITHOUT CONSULTING ME AND OBTAINING PERMISSION", I removed
it.

The second would PCLSR any job that PEEK suspected might be an interesting
job device server.  Any job whose JNAME started with the three characters
"JOB" would be PCLSR'd when PEEK went into "C" mode because PEEK used
.IOT's on the USR: device to probe around in its memory (to see if it was
an MLDEV, or other device server it knows about).  I fixed this to use
memory mapping instead.

In the case of the DQ device screw, I don't really understand why PEEK
PCLSRing the -server- would cause any kind of deadlock to be broken.  But
in any case, now there is a good chance that the next time COMSAT and DQ
get into this state, the mere act of discovering the lossage in PEEK (by
going into "C" mode to read the STATS file) will not cause the lossage to
vanish.  Perhaps we will be able to find the problem now.

(Oh bleep, let's put this on namecallers and get it over with already).

    From: Chris Lindblad <CJL@OZ.AI.MIT.EDU>

    Alan points out that when generating the hosts3 table, you only have to
    be compatible with people who have been using the hosts3 table.

Not quite.  Eg, JIS has MIT-OA.MIT.EDU as the IN-ADDR translation for
18.10.0.79, so if anybody out there is still using the old cannonical
name algorithm (name->address->name) they will think that is OA's
primary name, thus will include it in mail headers, thus people using
HOSTS3.BIN should be able to recognize it to avoid barfing on replies.
This is probably not as much of a problem for AI as for LCS because of
the relative numbers of TCP/IP machines.

    There are bugs in your algorithm anyway. You are taking the name MITAI
    and generating MIT-MITAI.ARPA, which was never in any domain. (The arpa
    domain only contained the primary names of hosts). 

Mea culpa.

    I really think it is silly to be genrating all these names. Just because
    JIS was lazy, and made names like mit-foo.mit.edu shouldn't be a reason
    for us to clutter our host tables with them. I suggest that as soon as
    possible, we eliminate references to the mit.edu domain. The longer
    they're there, the harder it will be to take them out, and there's no
    better time to make changes like this than during IAP.

Agreed.  I never intended that all that cruft be there permenantly,
just for transition to try to keep the world from falling apart too
badly too fast.  IAP does seem like a good time to punt it.

    Over the next year, more than 100 hosts will be added to the host table.
    We better start making each entry more compact if we expect it to keep
    working. Alan says that we have only two pages left.

Right, but the key point is that HOSTS3 isn't going to work much
longer.  One of two things will happen: (1) the NIC table will no
longer be anything like exhaustive, in which case the table is
incomplete, or (2) the NIC table will grow to the point where it is
completely unusable.  My guess is that we will end up with a
HOSTS3.BIN that contains info for MIT, and Chaos-only machines will
either have to grok domains or just start blindly sending mail to some
forwarder if the address is unrecognized.  Eventually HOSTS3 may
become identical with HOST3C if/when chaos machines grok domains, but
that's not for a while yet.

    For the AI host table. I would be happy if you didn't generate any
    names, and I specify all the names I want.

Ok.  Nag me if you don't hear about this in the next few days.

Ugh, bletch!  Yuck!  I just had to go and shuffle the memory layout in
(*gag*) PEEK because the HOSTS3 table has grown to be so huge that PEEK has
trouble keeping both it and ITS mapped in at the same time.  (Gumby, this
is what caused that PEEK bug you discovered the other day.)  If HOSTS3 gets
to be another -two- ITS blocks long, it is going to take some serious
thinking to keep PEEK working.  Presumably there are other programs out
there that, like PEEK, simply were not designed with a 73 block host table
in mind.

I notice that the current host table contains shitloads of totally
ridiculous host names.  A particularly bad example is AI which has the
names:

AI.AI.MIT.EDU
AI
AI.MIT.EDU
MIT-AI
MIT-AI.ARPA
MIT-AI.MIT.EDU
MIT-MITAI
MIT-MITAI.ARPA
MIT-MITAI.MIT.EDU
MITAI
MITAI.AI.MIT.EDU
MITAI.MIT.EDU

Might I suggest eliminating any name that starts with "MIT-" and ends
".MIT.EDU"?  (Also in the case of AI, I think we can do without the nicname
"MITAI" (without hyphen) and its derivatives.)

Re:   Supdup lossage

In supdup'ing from Harvard (Unix 4.3) to Mit-MC, everything seems to work
perfectly until I try to run Peek.  In particular, if I type ahead the
Peek command (e.g. `P^KJ'), it hangs up.  The only way I seem to be able
to get out of this state is to quit (^^q) the supdup and reconnect.
Actually, now that I do the test, it appears that even without typeahead,
Peek's interrupt characters (commands) never get through. -- p^K ... wait
for end of display (space worrks fine at end of screen) ... q [hangs up].
The input characters do seem to be buffered up somewhere, because when
you type ^Z when it's hung up and before you quit, when you reconnect,
the peek has been ^Z'd.

        else on the Arpanet.  Say ":P A".  PEEK will clear the screen, and
        then do nothing.

OK, I found the problem.  It turns out to be in CRTSTY when acting as
a SUPDUP user program (CTN).  By using IPLIST (like using a howitzer on a
housefly) I found that PEEK was sending %TDORS, and ITS was waiting
for the remote site to respond with the appropriate Intelligent Terminal
Protocol sequence (^\ ^P <V> <H>, which reports the cursor position)
before allowing PEEK to do anything else!  Since CTN was not responding
with that sequence until the user typed some input (due to a spazz
by whoever wrote the %TDORS handling code), the effect was that whenever
any ITS program did a .RESET TYOC, all output would stop until the user
became impatient...  as it happens, PEEK does such a reset every time
any character is typed at it.

I have merged the fix into the SYSENG source of CRTSTY.

Something is obviously screwing you, but I still can't duplicate it.
The previous tests were conducted under a variety of UNAMEs.
Here are the gory details of my latest attempt.

I logged into MC over 1200 baud dialup, and did :TN NIC and logged in
over there.  I ran @TELNET MC and NIC connected me to MC where I
received a DDT and did not log in (having made arrangements with PWORD
for this earlier).  I typed ":P A".  I got the same results as
yesterday -- PEEK worked.

I flushed all my connections back to MC and typed ":TN NIC".  I logged
into NIC and did "@TELNET MC". NIC connected me to MC and I logged in
as a normal user without any init file.  I typed ":P A", and PEEK
worked.  I typed "J" and it worked; I used "X" to gun myself down.

Maybe somehow the problem is terminal-type specific.

    Here is how to tickle the PEEK bug.  Connect to MC from somewhere
    else on the Arpanet.  Say ":P A".  PEEK will clear the screen, and
    then do nothing.

I did some tests from various net hosts (using TELNET to get to the
remote site, and their TELNET to get to MC.)  I invoked PEEK with
":PEEK", and ":P A", and excersized the A,J,N,Z, and X commands.
I tried several of these tests 2 or 3 times.

1. PEEK works normally over LispM or MINITS Chaosnet SUPDUP.

2. Over a MINITS Chaosnet TELNET connection, PEEK works normally,
   except that it does not update the display automatically.  
   PEEK starts up, displays whatever it is supposed to *twice*,
   and then just sits there, and you have to type another command,
   or use SPACE or Z.  I think it is supposed to be a feature that
   there is a long (infinite?)  initial sleep time when the
   console is a printing terminal.  All the commands seem to work.
   It is a bug that on a printing terminal it does the initial 
   display twice.

3. I tested PEEK TNing to MC from SCORE, being a Datamedia
   terminal.  PEEK worked normally.

4. From BRL-BMD as a printing terminal, the sucky TCP connection
   was almost unbearably slow, but PEEK seemed to behave the same
   as on a MINITS Chaos TELNET connection.

5. From SRI-NIC as a printing terminal, PEEK seemed to behave the
   same as on a MINITS Chaos TELNET connection.  BTW, the thing
   which it echoes at ":P A" is an "A" (folowed by the correct
   display.)

6. As a final test, I came in from SRI-NIC and :TCTYP DM2500.
   I typed ":P A".  It echoed "A", paused for 1 second, and
   gave me one normal ARPAnet display.  After 20 seconds it
   updated it.  I typed "J", and it did.  I used the "X"
   command to gun myself down.


Beats me to death.

Here is how to tickle the PEEK bug.  Connect to MC from somewhere
else on the Arpanet.  Say ":P A".  PEEK will clear the screen, and
then do nothing.  That's right, nothing.  Eventually you will get
impatient, and type a space.  Bang!  Suddenly there is a flash
of something echoed too quickly to see (^A?), and the PEEK "A" display
appears.  As far as X and Y go, nothing will happen.  I don't know if
all this is something net-specific, but if it is it should be flushed.
Possibly the JCL handling is messed up?

It seems to be solidly repeatable.

When I run PEEK, it automatically displays things for me.  The X and Y
commands work fine for me.  Glancing at a source compare of the latest
PEEK with the version from 1983, the only changes I see are where
people have installed some meter modes for some network stuff.

However, there is a very old bug which bites me sometimes, where PEEK
apparently does not turn its interrupts on or something.  When it gets
to a **MORE** break, it hangs (and the prompt is wrong so the more
handler has clearly not gone off.)  I think that in this mode, no
characters typed do anything.  Somebody should track this down
someday, but it is sporadic and has been happenning for years.

Are you thinking of this latter bug, or are you claiming that PEEK is
completely broken?  It normally works fine for me many times each day.

For a few months now I've noticed that PEEK has been broken.  I
wasn't quite sure whether to believe it at first, but now I'm
relatively sure.  The problem is that PEEK does not go ahead and
show things on its own -- you hae to type a space or something to force
output, it seems.  For certain commands like X and Y it simply does
not work or do anything.  Now, I grant this may hae happened because of
someone's idea of "new improved featurefulness" but I find it annoying.

First, you could just re-own the wholine job with :JOB WHOLIN
and then :KILL it, rather than using PEEK.   I don't know why
PEEK behaves the way you describe, but someone can look at it
someday I guess.

I had a detached tree which I was trying to kill in peek.
   I couldn't kill it.   Basically I just wanted to get rid of
my wholin which was disowned and screwing me.   number, etg. 32Y
offered to kill my entire tree (two hactr*'s) and I thought this
was a bug.  I got rid of some useless jobs so that if it actually
went and killed the tree off I could live also.  But they still wouldn't
got away.  5 minutes later, the system console printed that
it killed my hour old detached job.  If this is at all interesting,
I can provide some more info, but I don't want to bore you all otherwise.

To: BUG-PEEK @ MIT-MC

P pretends it is warning you that the system is being taken down. however,
the warning code is fukt. the warning (in the J display, at least) looks like
System going down in <timeA> (<timeB>)
where <timeA> is supposedly the remaining increment until the actual <timeB>
occurs. you'd expect that <timeB> would remain constant and <timeA> would
decrement to 0. what really happens, though, is <timeA> remains constant
(and doesn't jibe with the down warnings produced at top level), and <timeB>
increments to fit <timeA>!! please fix.

Sigh, every time I peek at the comsat stats file it gives me
an :$MPV not handled$ error and punts. This time after perhaps 
two screenfuls. I'm on a vt100 running in vt52 mode, and I have
had this happen on vt100s running vt100 mode, and H19s.

When I use LOCK to take the system down, it used to say 
'System going down in 15:00' or whatever.
Now it says:
'System going down in  3:06:21:21  ( 3:09:28:44)'
These huge mysterious numbers are not very helpful.

wierd Peek...
Peek seems not only to not allow you to type a space to redisplay
during an "O", but it also sometimes gets into a state where a space
will not do anything, no how... I can identify this state because
the "More" at the bottom will be

**More**

instead of

--More--

I regret that at this instant I cannot tell you how to produce this
state.  But I suspect it might be related to hopping in and out of
PEEK repeatedly... as I sometimes do... then one time I suddenly
notice this wierdness...
I consider this highly wierd, and am sending this to you, to forward
as you please, since I believe it was you who last modified PEEK.
Cheers.

If i type ahead stuff at peek (like i do
peek
jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
)
then i can make it use **MORE** rather than --More--.
This is especially amusing because in **MORE** in peek, the two things
which do not work are space and rubout.
