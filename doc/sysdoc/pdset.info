PDSET was re-written from scratch in 1985, so it now has a nicer
user interface, but does essentially the same work as described in
this file.  That is, it hacks PDTIME and the clock, and the backup
PDYTIM, and FYEAR.  --- CSTACY

The following information pertains to the old PDSET program circa 1969.
  
  SYS:TS PDSET IS A PROGRAM FOR THE
SETTING OF SYSTEM VARIABLES ASSOCIATED
WITH THE KEEPING OF REAL TIME IN ITS
VERSIONS 547 AND GREATER. IT DOES
THIS ON THE BASIS OF TYPED IN COMMANDS,
EXCEPT THAT IT MAY BE CALLED BY
:PDSET YYMMDD HHMMSS FROM DDT, WHERE
YYMMDD AND HHMMSS ARE THE DATE AND
TIME IT IT STARTED ($G'D BY DDT).
  WHEN PDSET IS FIRST STARTED
UP, IT ENTERS IOT USER MODE IN ORDER
TO DATAI FROM A HARDWARE CLOCK, SO DON'T
PLAY WITH ITS BINARY CASUALLY.
  WHEN NOT STARTED UP BY :PDSET YYMMDD HHMMSS,
PDSET TAKES TYPED IN COMMANDS IN MUCH
THE SAME MANNER AS TENLOD, WITH WHICH
IT SHARES THE Q, X, AND ? COMMANDS.
AFTER EACH CHARACTER IS TYPED IN AND
BEFORE IT IS ECHOED, PDSET DOES A
DATAI FROM THE HARDWARE CLOCK, AS WELL
AS A .RDTIME. IT IS ON THE BASIS OF
THIS INFORMATION, AS WELL AS THAT TYPED
IN, THAT IT DOES WHAT IT DOES.

MAIN COMMANDS: 

D  SET DATE. ACCEPTS A SIX
   DIGIT (YYMMDD) LEADING ARGUMENT OR,
   IF NOT SUPPLIED, THEN SETS A FLAG
   TO USE THE SYSTEM DATE (INITIAL MODE).

C  SET CENTURY. ACCEPTS A TWO
   DIGIT LEADING ARGUMENT.

T  SELECT *THE *TIME *AT *WHICH *THE
   *SETLOC *COMMAND *WILL *BE *GIVEN*.
   (HHMMSS 24 HR-TYPE LEADING ARGUMENT).

!  MUST BE FOLLOWED BY A POINT.
   THE TIME THE "." IS TYPED IS ASSUMED
   TO BE THE TIME SELECTED BY THE
   MOST RECENT "T" COMMAND. IF THE
   HARDWARE CLOCK IS RUNNING THEN PDSET
   .SETLOC'S A LOCATION IN THE SYSTEM
   WHICH THE SYSTEM USES AS AN OFFSET
   FOR TRANSLATING CLOCK DATAI'S INTO
   TIME OF YEAR. IF THE CLOCK IS NOT
   RUNNING, IT .SETLOC'S ANOTHER
   LOCATION IN THE SYSTEM TO THE TIME
   OF YEAR (FOR USE BY THE SYSTEM AS
   BACKUP TO THE HARDWARE CLOCK).
   EITHER WAY IT ALSO .SETLOC'S THE
   LOCATION IN THE SYSTEM CONTAINING THE
   YEAR, ALTHOUGH THIS WILL USUALLY
   NOT CAUSE SYSTEM JOB PRINTOUT
   DUE TO AGREEMENT.
   IN SHORT, THIS COMMAND DOES WHATEVER
   IT THINKS NECESSARY TO TELL THE
   SYSTEM WHAT TIME OF WHAT YEAR IT IS.
