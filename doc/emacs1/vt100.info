For those of you with VT100 terminals if you run in ANSII mode, the
VT100 library, which you can get via

   MM Load LibraryVT100

will set up the keypad to do pretty reasonable things as follows:

(1) Keypad digits and minus are args to the next command automatically.
    [Normal digits in main key area are self-inserting still].

(2) Comma will eventually be an arg separator for advanced commands that
    take precomma args. I haven't coded this yet.

(3) Dot runs ^R Documentation like ^_H or Top-H would normally do.

(4) Arrows go vertically up, down, back and forth, independent of what
    you define ^B,^F,^N,or ^P to do ...

(5) PF1-4 run macros you can define. They are initially undefined.

(6) Enter followed by a PF-key will read characters like the ^X(...^X) does
    up until the next ^X), C-M-C, or Enter that you type. You can abort
    a definition by doing ^].

Sorry for the length of the message, but hopefully this will be of interest
to enough of you to make it worthwhile.

Interestingly enuf, this will not work on AI. No, I am not boycotting -- I
just don't know what the new Emacs over there has done and I am nearly sure
that my stuff is wholely incompatible at this point ... when the new emacs
works its way back over to MC (which is happening slowly now), I will work
on an all-ITS compatible version of the handler.
