The TIME Library			Sunday, 23 December 1979

This library is for keeping a modeline clock. To start the clock,
just do:

	MM & Start Realtime Modeline Clock

If no arg is given, it will update every minute. If an arg is given,
it's the number of seconds to wait between updates.

The bug that caused this clock to update only half as often as it was
supposed to has been fixed.

The mode line clock will now update even in recursive-^R modes.

To get only the time and not the date, do

	1 m.vTime Only

in an init file.

This library clobbers the AutoSave facility's ability to wake up in
realtime and save your file every few minutes if needed. To make up for
that, you can do

	m(m.m & Enable MODLIN AutoSave)

in your Emacs init file after loading this library. This will enable
a pretty much equivalent capability.
