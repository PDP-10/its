The MAXIMA library			Sunday, 23 December 1979

The MAXIMA library defines the command MM Maxima Mode

It has the following features:

 C-M-A - Beginning of Macsyma Definition
 C-M-E - End of Macsyma Definition

Electric tokens:  ; $ := 
 If any of these are typed, it will type a carriage return after inserting
 them. In the case of :=, it will also auto-indent.

Parens/Braces/Brackets
 These now use the builtin paren matching features of new Emacs. Echoing
 of matches plus beeping on mismatches is standard.

Comments
 Meta-; and the related comment hacking commands know about /* and */

Syntax
 Appropriate adjustments have been made for making C-M- and M- commands work
 right on Macsyma tokens.

Indentation
 This mode just uses Lisp Mode indentation. That turns out to be right a 
 lot of the time. At some later date a real Macsyma indentation algorithm
 may be devised.
