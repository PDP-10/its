                          ITS Tape-Saving Project

    Project MAC, whence descended the AI Lab and LCS, developed a highly
unusual operating system called ITS (Incompatible Timesharing System).  For
many years it was the only, or the chief, OS used at the labs, so most of
the seminal work done here was done on machines running ITS.  Full ITS
first ran on the AI PDP6, and was ported to the DM PDP6.  Later, PDP10s
became available, and the labs acquired some of the earliest ones -- the
AI-KA10 (AI Lab's machine), the ML KA-10 (used by the MathLab, Theory of
Computation, Automatic Programming, and certain other LCS groups), and the
DMS KA-10 (Dynamic Modeling Systems, also used by certain other LCS
groups); these replaced the PDP-6s, which were slowly phased out.  The
well-known MACSYMA program was started on the AI-KA, moved to the ML-KA
when that machine came online and there underwent much development, and
finally needed some space to really run.  At that point the Macsyma
Consortium was established and bought MC, the first KL-10A installed
outside DEC.  MACSYMA continued to be upgraded on MC, as well as used by
the many Macsyma Consortium customers, who often stored their data and
special applications on the KL.
    After many years of overuse and under-maintenance, the latter generally
performed by a small cadre of lab members who stole time from their other
responsibilities to keep the machines going, the old ITS machines have
slowly surrendered to the ravages of time, and gone the way of all silicon.
The KAs were disposed of about four years ago.  The KL, renamed MX in 1986,
is reeling; while it was recently revived, its disk drives and memory boxes
are in very bad shape, and we expect to dispose of it soon.  The old ITS
machines have been replaced by new, physically smaller, much more easily
maintainable KS-10s (DEC-2020s), which sustain the ITS operating system
(which, like the recently lamented Multics, contains many system features
that are just now being discovered by the outside world), its atmosphere of
cooperation in research, and what (after fifteen years) is still one of the
best mail-delivery systems on the Internet.
    Why, when the old machines have been replaced by new hardware, is any
comment needed?  Because the AIKA, the MLKA, and the KL all had 7-track,
800bpi (bits per inch) tape drives, and all their backup tapes were written
on these drives.  Even as early as the mid-1970s, 7-track drives were being
superseded by 9-track drive technology; by now, 7-track drives are
impossible to find.  So the labs now possess a couple rooms full of backup
tapes written at 7 tracks -- the tapes contain the labs' history, but due
to the track difference, are unreadable on any hardware the labs now own or
are likely to be able to get.  Moreover, since the tapes were written at
800bpi, they fill two rooms' worth of space, which the labs would prefer to
put to more productive use.

    We want to preserve the labs' history, and free that space, by copying
a certain subset of those tapes to modern format.  For that reason, LCS has
had the KL repaired one last time, so the old tapes can be read on its
drive, and using available software, copied to the more modern format of 9
tracks, 6250bpi.  We propose to copy approximately one full dump per year
per ITS, as well as all the GFR tapes (Grim File Reaper -- a rough
equivalent of Twenex archiving); this should include on the order of 900
old tapes, which will be copied onto 175-200 new tapes.  When this project
has been accomplished, the new tapes will contain most of the work done on
the old ITS machines, and all the old 7-track tapes can then be disposed
of.  We realize that not everything will be saved, but this method of
copying snapshots and GFRs should preserve most of the labs' important
work.
    Concerning DM: for some reason, the DM-KA had a 9-track, 800bpi drive,
so all its backup tapes were written in that format.  As long as LCS
maintains a similar format drive (suitable drives are now in use on XX),
the DM tapes will be readable; a small program would need to be written to
translate the data, but the ITS tape format is simple and well-documented,
so such a project should be trivial for any competent systems programmer.
Of course, when the labs consider disposing of their last drives which read
9-track, 800bpi tapes, or when LCS wants to free the space currently used
by the DM-KA tapes, a project like this one should be undertaken to
preserve the DM history.


Requirements:
    Time: Each tape takes about 10 minutes to copy, if everything goes
well.  However, due to tape age and in some cases frequent use, as well as
machine and network trouble, problems do occur, so a safer estimate would
be 15 minutes per tape.  For 900 tapes, that translates as 225 hours of
copying, or approximately 5 weeks' work for one person (at standard 40hr.
weeks).  With some competent assistance during hours when I am not
available, this period might be halved.  These estimates are based on Alan
Bawden's work copying some of the MX GFR tapes to 1600bpi; since GFR tapes
are by far the most abused ITS backups, the full dump tapes might not
produce as many problems, but it is prudent to assume they will.
    Material: We need about 200 new 2400' tapes, of quality suitable for
having data written at 6250bpi.  A moderate quantity of documenting
paraphernalia will be needed to label them all.
    Hardware: The MX-KL must keep running in at least as good shape as it
currently does; it has the only available 7-track drive.  The Chaosnet,
specifically Subnet 6, the piece on which the ITS machines reside, must
bear traffic well; it is the only way for the KL to send the tape data out.
At least one of the AI Lab machines with 6250bpi tape drives (HERMES,
VULCAN) must be usable, because they are the only sites the new tapes can
be written.  The LCS machine MILO has a 6250bpi drive but is not on the
Chaosnet, and so is unusable for this purpose.
    Software: Already available; written by Dave Moon of Symbolics.
    People: Me, at full time or so for 3-4 weeks.  Some effort from Ty and
his crew when they are here but I'm not.  Assistance at troubleshooting
from Alan Bawden (AIL), John Wroclawski (LCS), and if necessary Dave Moon
(Symbolics), to keep the hardware functional and solve any remaining
software bugs.
    Possible other expenses: Tom Knight (AIL) has suggested that the new
tapes, once written, should be copied (thus providing us 2 complete set of
the snapshots and GFRs), and that one of these sets should be stored
somewhere other than in NE43.  Such copying can be done, he says, by
outside firms for a relatively modest price.  There is precedent for
storing lab tapes offsite; for several years, many of the ITS backup tapes
were stored in the old wind tunnel building; they were returned here when
IPS (now IS) took over that space for its main computer facility.

              A prospective set of old ITS tapes to be copied

Note that not all input tapes are full, and some may be unreadable.  If a
particular dump provides an excess of problems, we will have to use another
nearby chronologically, and adjust the remainder accordingly.  Any output
tape used to finish copying a full dump will end up only partially full.
Prefer using "Archive" dumps to "Full" dumps; on the other hand, prefer
using tapes not marked as having been hit by the basement flood to those
marked as so doused.
    The software does not allow splitting of input tapes onto output tapes;
in other words, any input tape which runs off the end of the output tape
it's being copied onto must be started again on a new output tape.  We know
that due to differences in inter-record gaps, 2 800bpi tapes sometimes fit
onto one 1600bpi tape, and sometimes run over (requiring a second 1600bpi
tape).  We don't know what the 800-6250 ratio will be; division suggests
that 7 old tapes will fit onto 1 new tape, but Dave Moon suspects that the
inter-record gap diffence will allow only 5-6 old tapes per new one.  The
conservative ratio of 1:5 has been used in the table below; we might be
able to do better, but should not count on it.
    To retain coherency among the new tapes, each full dump will be copied
to a separate set; thus for each full dump, there will be one new tape only
partially full, containing its last files.  Tape is not expensive enough to
subject future users of these tapes to the confusion that would result from
jamming all tapes full without leaving these gaps.  GFR tapes, however, can
be copied as many as fit per tape.
    In the tables below, an input dump date preceded by * indicates an
alternate to the previous dump.  I use the most conservative number of
output tapes needed for all sets of possible alternates.  Note that ITS
archive dumps are pretty much regular full dumps; originally there was an
intent to save them longer or treat them as more sacred than ordinary full
dumps, but this seems to have been washed away in the basement flood (in
which many of the arch dump tapes were caught) if not earlier.

Addendum: All tapes actually copied have been recorded in the copy logbook.
The prospective lists below have also been altered to indicate tapes
actually copied, up to the dashed lines; everything below them is still
prospective and subject to change.
    Also, the old to new tape ratio is proving to be more like 4:1 than
5:1.  This varies depending on file size; also, some tapes are not full,
and thus throw off this standard ratio.
    Also, all tapes marked ! are part of the time compromise.  All such
tapes are figured for a 4:1 compression ratio, although some will fit 5:1.
