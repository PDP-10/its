     The program consists of GOSET1 FASL and GOSET2 FASL in my 
directory in ML.  After FASLOADING them, set the size of the
board to whatever you like (standard game is 19).  This is controlled
by the variable SAIZ; e.g, (SETQ SAIZ 19).
     These commands are available to the player:

(RICEIP)            Clears the board for a new game.  Type this before
                      your first game.

(PLAY x y -1)       Plays a white stone on point (x,y).

(PLAY x y 1)        Plays a black stone on point (x,y).

(PLAY x y 0)        Removes any stone from point (x,y).

(PORTREI)           Shows you the board.

(BLEK)              This is the program that plays against you.  If you
                      call this, it will make the best move for black 
                      that it can think of.

     White stones are represented by O, black stones by X.
     Here's the beginning of an example game:

. . . and so on.
     If you want to play with a handicap, you must place the stones 
yourself.  The program knows when the game is over (when neither it nor
you desires to play a stone), but it does not know how to score:  you 
must do that yourself.  The program will say "Atari" to warn you when it
endangers some of your stones.  It automatically removes dead stones
from the board, and will not play illegally in a KO situation.  It will
let you cheat in many ways, but is that what you're here for?
     The program mutters to itself while it thinks--do not be alarmed by
this.  It may take as much as two minutes for a move.  Once again, I 
invite comments on playing ability and program bugs.
