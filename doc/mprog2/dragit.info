<USE "DRAGIT">
<DRAGON>
<SUMMARY>

gives you a summary of the current month as far as it has gone.

	<DRAGON -input-file-:string>

-input-file- defaultly is "DRAGON;DRAGON HOARD", and if an argument is given,
   SNM is "DRAGON" by default and NM2 is "REPORT".

	<SUMMARY -data-and-flags-:tuple>

-data-and-flags- uses the data produced by DRAGON if the first element of the
   tuple is not a vector.  Remaining elements define what to print:  if nothing
   is given, everything is printed.  R prints "runs" info, G prints groups
   info, and T prints "totals" info.  "Runs" is what was previously done by the
   Teco macro, "Groups" is a summary line for each group in the Dragon file,
   and "Totals" is the summary line that goes in "1979 SUMMRY".

   If the first thing in the tuple is a string, the output will go to that
   file.  E.g.,

	<SUMMARY "april summry">

   will stuff the full summary to that file. 

,SDATA!-IDRAGIT is the unparsed string data
,DATA!-IDRAGIT is the parsed data

Have fun.
