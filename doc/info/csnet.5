CSNET: A Computer Science Network

CSNET is a cooperative effort of computer scientists to establish a
computer-based communications network which will interconnect computer
science research groups in universities, industry and government.

Based on recent advances in computer network technology, including
international protocol standards and the availability of commercial
packet networks, CSNET will provide a feasible means for collaborative
work at the forefront of computer science research.

The benefits to the community are expected to be very significant,
when compared to initial investments and continuing costs.  
In particular, CSNET will help to solve two critical problems which
the computer science community now faces:  severe personnel
shortages and low productivity in software development.

CSNET will reach an important milestone in 1984.  
After a successful three-year development effort, the network will
become a fully operational utility, offering telephone and high-speed
public data network access for CSNET members and an online database of
user information.  Since 1981, membership in CSNET has grown from a
handful of institutions to nearly 100, representing many of the major
academic and corporate research centers in the United States.

From its inception, CSNET was intended to become a self-financing and
self-managing organization based on member support.  To this end, the
National Science Foundation has awarded a new contract to the
University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) in Boulder,
Colorado to assume the management of CSNET.  UCAR was chosen in part
because of its long experience with and commitment to member-run
organizations: it is a non-profit corporation which for 25 years has
managed a major scientific facility, the National Center for
Atmospheric Research, on behalf of a consortium of more than 50
universities.

How to use CSnet

Currently, CSNET is implemented as an electronic mail relay network
called Phonenet. Messages are relayed between hosts over telephone
lines.

MIT is connected to the ARPAnet, which is part of the DoD Internet.
The CSnet is not part of the Internet, but there is a way to send
messages between users on the two network communities.

There are two relay machines, one on each coast, which are on both the
ARPAnet and the CSnet.  These are CSNET-RELAY (east) and RAND-RELAY
(west).

To send mail to someone on CSnet, you must know their mailbox name and
which CSnet host they receive their mail on.  By specifying their
addresses in a (kludgey) special way, you can route mail through one
of the relay machines onto the CSnet.

You must also choose which of the relay machines you wish to send the
message through. This can be done by consulting the host/relay table
under the menu item "Hosts".

From the ARPAnet, the form of a CSnet mailbox is:  "user.host@relay".

For example, smith.Umcp-Cs@CSNET-RELAY specifies the user named
"smith" at the University of Maryland, College Park, and that the
message is to be routed through the east coast relay.

Here is the latest CSnet (PhoneNet) host table showing official names
and aliases of hosts served by the Csnet and Rand relays.

Note that UDEL-RELAY is no longer the best relay for reaching any
PhoneNet sites.  Please update any aliases or mailing lists to reflect
the new relay assignments.

Besides the relay machines, CSnet operates two other machines on the
DoD Internet.  

The CSnet Coordination and Information Center uses CSNET-CIC.
The CIC periodically distributes newsletters and updates. 
This information is sent to your host liaison; you can get copies of
the material from that person if you are interested.  The CIC staff
can be reached by sending mail to "cic@CSNET-SH".  CIC also operates a
hotline telephone number:  (617) 497-2777.

The CSNET Service Host at the University of Wisconsin is now
operational.  This machine will provide various services, including
archiving of documents and the CSNET Name Server Directory Service.
When available, this Name Server will provide a high level of
directory assistance to the internet community.  The Service Host is a
component of the NSF sponsored CSNET project.

The Service Host is a VAX 11/750 running standard Berkeley UNIX (4.1
BSD).  It is currently connected to Arpanet and will soon have an X.25
connection to Telenet.  The ARPANET host name is CSNET-SH.


File: CSNET Node: Status,  Previous: Hosts,  Up: Top, Next: Documents

You can find out the status of the CSnet sites by sending a mail
message to the address "status@CSNET-RELAY".  A message agent
(program) will mail you back an automatic reply, and the
contents of your message will be ignored.

Here is a sample reply:

  -----

  This is an automatic reply for The Phonenet Status Reporter:
	      STATUS OF EXCEPTIONAL CSNET SYSTEMS

  The following summarizes the status of CSNET sites known to be 
  having difficulties.  If you wish more information on a particular 
  CSNET site, please contact the CSNET Coordination and Information 
  Center at <cic@csnet-sh> or the CIC hotline number (617)497-2777.
