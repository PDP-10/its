The GLP spooling system allows  queuing to the Gould Printer in 38-244
on the main M.I.T. campus.   GLP^F in DDT prints the list of pending requests.

Using GLP is very similar to using the XGP spooler so it is assumed the reader
is familiar with running :XGP in DDT.  If you are not, type a P to get back to
the documentation on XGP and read that first.  Only the differences between
:GLP and :XGP are described here.

Printing Files on the Gould Printer

There are 2 hardware modes in which the Gould printer can operate: LPT (line
printer) mode and bit-image mode.  LPT mode is much more efficient because the
output comes out faster and there is less computation involved in producing
such listings due to the fact that a hardware character generator is used to
construct the bit-image lines to be printed.  This is the default style of
output.  The bit-image mode is slower but much more general, and is used for
graphics output or XGP simulation.  This mode involves producing a complete
bit-image of the page on the PDP-10 and shipping it over the Chaos net to the
Gould.  Listings printed in LPT mode we will call LPT style and those printed
in bit-image mode we will call XGP style listings (since bit-image mode is
most commonly used to simulate the XGP for files containing XGP commands).

The simplest way to print a text file on the Gould is to do:

:GLP USERS;MY MAIL

which would print the file USERS;MY MAIL in LPT mode.  The GLP spooler is
somewhat clever however, in that it will attempt to determine the type of file
and print it in the appropriate mode.  For instance, if it can recognize the
first line of the file as an instance of some valid command found in XGP files
(e.g. ;SKIP 1 etc.) it will default to XGP style printing.  Graphics files of
various sorts are recognized also.  Thus, most of the time typing :GLP <file>
is sufficient to cause <file> to get printed correctly.  However,
occassionally this fails, so you may want to explicitly specify the file type
or you may want to specify some additional options to control printing.  When
it is determined that the file type is not a graphics file nor a file with XGP
commands produced by some document formatting program (TJ6, PUB, @, R, TEX,
TXJ, etc.), the default action is to provide a minimally structured output
format called LIST mode, where page numbering and a title line for each page
is provided.

The GLP queuer accepts file commands, which specify a file to be
printed and optionally a font to be used.  The general form is:

:GLP ;<file-command><file-specification>_<fonts-spec-list>/<flags>

for instance,

:GLP USERS;MY MAIL_25FR

would print the file DSK:USERS;MY MAIL in a type font called 25FR.  LPT style
listings can have only one font (the one built into the hardware) so when the
user specifies a font explicitly, this implies XGP (bit-image) style output.
Note the ;<file-command> has been ommitted in this case.   See the FONTS;,
FONTS1;, FONTS2; and XFONT; directories for the currently available font
styles or get a copy of the XGP font catalog.

A file command is usually either ;PRINT or ;LIST (if it is not specified it
defaults to ;LIST - this is different from the XGP where the default is
;PRINT).   ;PRINT specifies XGP style output as opposed to LPT style and thus
is the convenient way of forcing XGP style for plain files which are not
otherwise recognized as XGP style files.  In addition, however, GLP has
several file commands which are not used with :XGP, namely, ;LPT, ;ARDS,
;DPLT, ;IMAGE, and ;TEK.  All but the first of these will be discussed in the
section on graphics.  Several XGP file commands are not supported, including
;THESIS (there are no thesis forms for the Gould),  ;PLOT (use ;DPLT instead),
;TEST (you probably don't care about this).  ;SAMPLE is supported, and ;SCAN
may be supported someday (although it is really not too useful except on the
XGP).  ;LPT is used to force line printer style listings for files that would
otherwise default to XGP style.

Note that for XGP style listings, all commands in the file are interpreted
as they are by the XGP spooler ( *note XGP:(XGP)FILES. ).

If you have several files to queue at once, you may find it more convenient
to use the :GLP program in an interactive mode rather than via JCL as shown
above.  To do this you simply type :GLP<return> and the GLP program will
prompt you for input.  When all specifications have been completed, you
exit by typing ^C.  This works just like the :XGP program and more details
can be found under the XGP info (*note INPUT:(XGP)EDIT. ).

In summary, there are basically 3 ways files are listed on the Gould printer:
LPT listings, graphics files, or XGP simulation.  Nothing more will be said
about the last of these (XGP) since that is documented elsewhere.

Next, more details will be provided about the line printer mode.

LPT (line Printer) Style Listings

This listing style is used when you want a high speed line printer type
listing and is recommended for all temporary or lengthy listings of programs,
or other unformatted text.  In addition to being processed much faster, this
type of listing tends to come out with better quality.  Line printer mode
is the default when it can not be determined that the file contains particular
formatting or graphics commands.  LPT listings are printed in an 11 x 8.5
inch format rather than 8.5 x 11 (that is they are output with a 90 degree
rotation compared with ordinary documents printed in XGP style).  This is
simply a function of the hardware (rotation is not an option for LPT mode).
Page headings may be suppressed or specified explicitly, but the default
is to provide a heading containing the date, time, file name, and page number.

There are several options associated with LPT style listings.  These are
specified by adding /<option>:<value> to the end of a :GLP command.  The
:<value> is optional and is only required on commands which take arguments.
For example,

:GLP JLK;FOO >/NOHEADER/SKIP:2

would print the file JLK;FOO > with the page headers suppressed and the first
2 pages skipped.  The options relevant to LPT mode are listed below:

LFTMAR, BOTMAR, TOPMAR		Sets the left margin, bottom margin, or top
	margin.  Unlike the XGP, these are specified in units of character
	lines for LPT style listings.

NLINES, WIDTH			Sets the total number of lines on a page or
	the total width of the page in character units.  Note the SIZE command
	is not used for LPT mode.

LIST, HW			Enable automatic page headers (page numbering).
	These options are the same.  Normally, these are not needed since they
	default to be on, but see the FORTRAN option.


FORTRAN				Interpret FORTRAN forms control codes in column
	1 of the file.  1 means do a formfeed, 0 means double space, and
	anything else means single space.  Note that this option causes
	suppression of automatic page headers, so use /FORTRAN/LIST to get
	both.

SKIP:<arg>			Skip <arg> pages.

WRAPAROUND, TRUNCATE		Set the default action for lines longer than
	the page width.  Normally, wraparound is assumed.

HEADING:<arg>			Set the page heading text to <arg>.  This does
	not include the page number which will come out in addition.

^CONTROLS			Set the mode for control characters to print
	with a caret preceeding them rather than as some funny Gould graphic.

FFCUT, NOCUT			Cut the paper only on formfeeds (^L) or do
	not cut the paper at all.

Examples:
To get a FORTRAN listing with page numbering do

:GLP MYPROG FTN/FO/L

Note that only the minimum number of characters is needed to uniquely specify
the option (/L is a special hack which implies /LIST).  The long form for this
would have been :GLP MYPROG FTN/FORTRAN/LIST.

To get a listing with 60 lines per page and 120 columns

:GLP RANDOM FILE/NLINES:60/WIDTH:120

The defaults are NLINES=69., WIDTH=132., BOTMAR=2., TOPMAR=5., LFTMAR=0.

To get a listing with your own page header

:GLP A FILE/HE:This is a string without a slash in it./SKIP:1

where the header line will be "This is a string without a slash in it." and
the first page will be skipped.

Printing Graphics Files on the Gould

The Gould spooler can currently print graphics files using ARDS, Tektronix,
DPLT, and IMAGE formats.  ARDS files are most commonly produced by the MACSYMA
PLOT2 package or Muddle graphics.  Tektronix files usually originate on some
other machine and are copied to MC for printing.  DPLT files are produced by
the Stanford Drawing System (SUDS) or GEOMED.  Image files are raw bit data.
In the future more types will be added (FR80, ITS, SCAN, etc).

Normally, graphics files are recognizable by the spooler so all one needs
to do to get a file printed is to do :GLP <graphics file> however occassionally
this doesn't work (especially for Tektronix files whose format is not uniquely
defined - it looks for ^L at the beginning of the file) so you can explicitly
specify the type by a file command such as ;ARDS, ;DPLT, ;TEK, ;IMAGE, etc.
For example, the typical way to print a Tektronix file is

:GLP ;TEK USERS;NETOUT >         or        :GLP MYTEK FILE/TEK

Note that some systems, such as MACSYMA, automatically queue files for
printing, so you don't usually have to use :GLP to cause your file to be
printed (assuming you have used one of the HARDCOPY features).  However, if
you have a plot saved on disk which you wish to have printed, you can do

:GLP ;ARDS SAVED PLOT            or        :GLP SAVED PLOT/ARDS

SUDS drawings files are printed by writing a PLT file which you then queue by

:GLP ;DPLT FOO PLT              or         :GLP FOO PLT/DPLT

Note that the second file name defaults to ARDS, TEK, or PLT depending on
the specified file command.

Several options exist which apply uniformly to all the graphics types:

SCALE	Normally 1.0, but a scale of 2.0 is double size, etc.  Must be
	a floating point number.

THICK	Thickness of lines drawn (normally 2 - must be an integer).

ROTATE	Rotation of the plot (normally 0).  Rotations of 0,1,2,3 are
	allowed which correspond to a counter-clockwise rotation from
	the default which causes the plot to come out 11 x 8.5 (similar
	to the orientation of LPT listings).  For DPLT plots, the default
	rotation is 3 which causes a 15 x 11 inch drawing to be printed.
	Rotation 0 for DPLT is the standard 11 x 8.5.

LFTMAR, BOTMAR  These are in raster units (200/in) and specify the offset
	of the lower left corner of the plot relative to that corner of
	of the paper (independent of rotation).

font spec   If a font specification is provided, that font will be used
	in plot labeling (except for PLT files).

Additional Options Specific to the Gould

ROTATE		Rotate the text on the page.  The default is 3 for XGP files
	and 0 for graphics files.  Rotations of 0,1,2,3 are allowed.  Rotation
	0 is 90 degress counterclockwise from 3.  The ROTATE specification
	must come before any KSET (font) specifications.

COPIES		Number of copies of the file to be printed (normally 1).
	May not be greater than 5.

BACKGROUND	0= normal (white) background, 1= black background.
	This is only occassionally useful for graphics or picture files.

OUTPUT		Output device (Gould or XGP), defaults to Gould (see next
	node for more details).

Other options are the same as for the XGP (*note OPTIONS:(XGP)SWITCHES. )

Output of SCAN files to the XGP

The Gould spooler is used for translating graphics files for output to the XGP
and for printing XGP files which cannot be directly on the XGP either because
certain lines contain too many characters for the buffering capacity of the
XGP PDP-11  or because the files contain a mixture of XGP and graphics (ARDS)
commands (*note XGP-ARDS:(GLPSPL;XGPARD DOC). ).

To cause output to the be directed to the XGP do

:GLP MyXGP FILE/OUTPUT:XGP

which will produce files .GLPR.;> SCN.  If the network and AI are up, these
files will automatically be copied to AI:.GLPR.;<n> SCN and queued for
printing.  If the automatic copy and queuing cannot be accomplished, the
spooler will send you a message informing you of that fact, in which case
you will have to manually copy the files from MC:.GLPR.; and queue them
yourself at some later time (the spooler does not keep a list of failed
XGP queue requests and ensure that they eventually get done - perhaps it
should...).

To see the status of the Gould queue, do GLP^F in DDT.
(This is provides information just like XGP^F *note status:(XGP)STATUS.)

Detailed information about the spooler job can be obtained by using the
PEEK program, namely

:PEEK ;JGLP

will show a display of the current state of the GLPSPL job.

File: GLP	Node: Control	Previous: Status	Next:Misc	Up: Top

To cancel a request which is still in the GLP queue, do GLP^F in DDT to
see the index number of the request you wish to cancel, and then do

:GLP ;CANCEL <n>

where <n> is the index number (this is the same as canceling things from
the XGP queue).

To abort a listing which is currently being printed, use :GABORT and it
will ask you if you really want to abort the current listing, telling you
which file is being printed.  It also sends a message to the user who made
the listing request telling him who aborted his listing.  This works only
on MC.

Miscellaneous Information about the Gould

The Gould is a 200 dot/in electrostatic matrix printer, which prints text
or bit patterns on (crufty) dielectrically coated paper.  Its theoretical
speed is 1.65 in/sec (across the page - the paper is 11" wide) but this
is only achieved in the line printer mode where hardware character generation
is used (but we are always hoping...).  The Gould spooling software can
simulate the XGP printer and has several capabilities which make it more
general (e.g. rotation, more fonts, graphics, etc).  It uses the same fonts
as the XGP, can print TEX files (which the XGP can not print directly).

PLEASE remember to leave the Gould on-line after you put it off-line to
feed the paper up to get your listing out (shades of ML LPT...).

Maintainers:  the GLP device (its a job device) is obtained by assembling
AI:SYSENG;XGPDEV >  with GLP==1.  The :GLP program is obtained by assembling
AI:SYSENG;XQUEUE > with GLP==1.

The main spooling program is MC:GLPSPL;GLPSPL > which is a LISP-based system
with many support files (ARDS, LPT, XGP, GLPFNT, GLPDRW, GLPSPT, etc.).
See the comments in GLPSPL for how to dump out a new spooler.  If the spooler
dies for some reason (as shown by :P ;JGLP), first see if JLK is around and
ask him to look at it, otherwise just run :GLPSPL;GLPSPL which will cause a
new spooler to get launched.  The GLPSPL program gets started automatically
when ITS comes up.
