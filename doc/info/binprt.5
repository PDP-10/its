BINPRT

:BINPRT <file>
	prints out assembly information on a binary file (i.e. "xxx BIN"
	or "TS xxx").  If no <file> is specified, the current :PRINT
	defaults are used.  For example:

*:BINPRT SYS:TS BINPRT
        --- MIDAS Provided Info ---

Assembled by ALAN on 08/22/81 02:19:54
Assembled from file MC: SYSEN1; BINPRT 96

File Type:  SBLK
:KILL
*


Switches:

/A	All info (both /D and /T)

/D	Data areas:
	  For SBLK (Small BLocK--absolute assembly): list of SBLK's specs
		Block #, Starting address, and Length of block.
	  For PDUMP (Page DUMP): Page's purity, writability, and share

/L	Location: where appropriate, shows file location of
		certain blocks.  This can be used for example to verify
		that binary compare failures are due to the MIDAS-provided
		info, which varies between assemblies.

/T	Text: prints all constant text strings in program.

/S	Source: Sets DDT's ^R default filename to be the name of
		the source file.
