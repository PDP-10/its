File: IMGOUT	Node: Top	Up: (DIR)

The IMGOUT program outputs its arguments (JCL) to the user's terminal in
image mode.  This is intended to be used for setting special terminal
modes, loading function keys and the like.  Note that one might save a
frequently used setup string in a DDT XFILE [*Note XFILE: (INFO;DDT)XFILE.]
or with the :X command [*Note X: (.INFO.;X)*].

. In general a contiguous string of numbers will get be interpreted as an
  octal value to be output as a single character; a trailing period will
  use the decimal value instead.

. Spaces can be used to delimit numbers, but are otherwise ignored unless
  quoted. 

. Alphabetic characters and most printing graphics are output as themselves.

. / quotes the next character, ie. causes it to be output no matter what it
  is.  This can be used to output numbers, spaces, ^'s, $'s ''s, and itself.

. ^ causes the next character to be "controllified", that is to say,
  zeros the 100 bit.

. $ (dollar sign) is translated to escape.

. Non-alphabetic printing graphics should always be quoted because they may
  take on new meaning without warning.

Some examples:

: The following 3 are equivalent 
:imgout 141 7 33 101 044
:imgout a ^G 33 65. /$
:imgout a^G$A/$

:imgout This/ is/ the/ terminal/ that/ is/ shot/ from/ guns.15 12

: Load the F1 key on a C100 to transmit the string :SEND 
:imgout 33 /4 38. 65  /" /:SEND/ 

Notes:

. CRTSTY: outputing to a terminal through CRTSTY should work.  Care should be
  taken in resetting terminal modes that CRTSTY may be depending on for
  correct operation.

. Neither CRTSTY or ITS terminal software will be cognizant of any changes
  :IMGOUT may make in the position of the cursor or the appearance of your
  terminal screen.


Future features?: (send me mail if any of these really excites you)
. ' for hexadecimal, + and - work between numbers for arithmetic,
. * for repetition?
. a version which takes its arguments from a file rather than the JCL
