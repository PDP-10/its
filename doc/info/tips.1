File: TIPS,  Node: Debugging JOB Devices,  Up: TOP, Next: Assembling a new ITS

ITS supports custom device handlers by using the JOB: device. Links to "virtual" 
devices are create in the DEVICE directory, such as:

   DEVICE; JOBDEV DB => DEVICE; ATSIGN MLDEV

The program DEVICE; ATSIGN MLDEV is called a BDH (BOJ Device Handler) and is
invoked when attempting to perform i/o on a device whose name appears in the FN2
of a DEVICE; JOBDEV <fn2> entry -- in this case, "DB:".  The JOB and BOJ devices
are described in SYSDOC; JOB > and all the information contained in that document
is not duplicated here. Refer to that document for basic information, including
high level instructions on how to debug BDHs. This INFO entry, gives an example
of how to debug the MLDEV BDH. A similar method can be used to debug any BDH.

The scenario is as follows: You discover that a job fails or an attempt to access 
a file using MLDEV gets an error. Say, for example, that you attempt the following
command:

   :listf no:sys;

where a link exists on your system from DEVICE; JOBDEV NO to DEVICE; ATSIGN MLDEV.
And when you do this, you can an error or a hang in the job and you discover that
there is a dead MLDEV job hanging around (perhaps it did a .VALUE). You in PEEK,
these jobs appears to have a JNAME of JOB.NN.  You want to debug why this is 
happening.

You need two login sessions to debug this easily -- two HACTRNs.  Assume in you
logged into one as EJS. First, create a job:

   mldev$j

Then, load in the MLDEV binary:

   $L device;atsign mldev

Patch the value of .OPTION to enable the %opojb bit (2000):

   *.option/   30000,,0   32000,,0

Set a breakpoint that will be hit when the BDH is invoked:

   go+4$b

Start the BDH going:

   $0g
    $p

In another HACTRN, say logged in as EJS0, set up a translation so that attempts
to access the NO device will invoke the BDH under debug:

   $^t no:,ojb:ejs;ejs mldev

Note: the two EJS instances above refer to the logged in HACTRN where MLDEV is being
debugged. The MLDEV refers to the JNAME of the JOB being debugged.

Now, in this HACTRN, access the NO device in whatever way you want. The easiest
way is to simply reference the device in a LISTF command:

   :listf no:sys;

This will appear to hang, but in the debugging HACTRN, your BDH job will have
stopped at the breakpoint. 

$1B; GO+4>>.CALL 3316 (RFNAME)

You are now free to debug the BDH to your heart's content.

File: TIPS,  Node: Creating a Bootable ITS Image,  Up: TOP

A directly bootable ITS image resides in a file in the "." directory, with
an FN1 of "@".  For example, the file ".;@ ITS" might be a directly bootable
ITS image. Such an image usually includes DDT, the Salvager, and ITS itself.

In order to create such an image, you need to have image files for each of
these components:

- DDT (e.g. ".;DDT BIN")
- Salvager (e.g ".;NSALV BIN")
- ITS (e.g. ".;ITS BIN")

Assuming each of the above files exists in the "." directory, in order to
produce a directly bootable ITS image (".;@ ITS"), you invoke the following
commands from DSKDMP:

   l$ddt bin
   t$its bin
   $U
   m$nsalv bin
   d$its

The "l" command clears memory and loads in a copy of DDT. The "t" command
loads in a copy of ITS, without clearing memory first and including the 
symbols for ITS. The resulting memory image includes both DDT and ITS. The
"$U" command restarts DSKDMP so that you can issue the "m" command to merge
in the salvager, NSALV.  Finally the "d" command dumps out the memory image
into a file in the "." directory, whose FN1 is "@" and whose FN2 is "its".

At this point, you have a directly bootable ITS image. You can either type:

   G$
   $g

or

   its
   $g

The first sequence sets the starting address and then executes the image from 
that starting address.

The second sequence loads the image from the file system (".;@ ITS") and then
starts it at the image's starting address.

Note: In the following description XX refers to the two-character ITS machine name
you are building -- for example DB.

1. First, examine SYSTEM; CONFIG > for changes you want to make. Look for the text

   IFE MCOND XX,[

to find the section for the machine named XX.

KA 10 options you may want to consider:

 - DC10P, RP10P: the kind of tape drives
 - TM10A or TM10B: the kind of tape drive.
 - NUNITS and NEWDTP: number and kind of DECtape drives
 - TEN11P to enable the Rubin 10-11 interface. Subordinate options are:
   - Knight TV, XGP, Chaos-11
 - PDP6P to use an auxiliary PDP-6
 - TK10P, DPKPP, MTYP: terminal ports
 - CH10P or T11CHP: the kind of Chaosnet interface

KS10 options:

 - RM03P, RM80P, RP06P, RP07P: the kind of disk drive
 - DZ11P: terminal prots
 - CH11P: Chaosnet interface

Common options:

 - NQS: the number of disk drives
 - IMPP: whether there is an IMP interface
 - NCPP, INETP, CHAOSP: network protocols

To change properties for terminals, edit SYSTEM; TTYTYP >.  Look for the section
titled MCCONDX XX,{

2. If you changed the disk configuration, you should probably reassemble (N)SALV and
DSKDMP too.  

SALV is used on the KA10 to check the disks. It is merged with ITS when you build a 
new ITS image. NSALV is the corresponding program for the KS10. 

DSKDMP is used for booting the machine or reading a program from disk for standalone
execution, and then starting it. 

Look for IFCE MCH,XX,[ in SALV or NSALV. Update parameters appropriately.

For DSKDMP, use one of the default configurations, or use ASK so that you are prompted
for parameters.

 - On a KA10, use the HRIFLG switch to make a new DSKDMP paper tape to boot from.
 - On a KS10, use the BOOOTSW switch to make a new DSKDMP boot block and save it as
   .; BT BIN.  THen write it to the front end system:

  :KSFEDR
  !WRITE
  Are you sure you want to scribble in the FE filesystem? YES
  Which file? BT
  Input from (Default DSK: FOO; BT BIN): .;BT BIN
  !QUIT

3.  Assemble ITS. It's prudent to store the binary file in the . directory with a new 
name. E.g. 

  :MIDAS .:NITS BIN_SYSTEM; ITS

Answer the question "MACHINE NAME =" with XX.

4.  Merge the ITS binary with DDT and (N)SALV.

There are two options for doing this. The normal way is to reboot and do it in 
DSKDMP. The other way is to do it in timesharing DDT.

 - DSKDMP method. Use this unless you have a good reason not to.

  a. Shut down ITS with LOCK. Reboot into DSKDMP. Use the new DSKDMP if you made
     one above. 
  b. Load DDT: l$ddt
  c. Give ITS and its symbols to DDT: t$nits bin
  d. You're now in DDT. Exit back to DSKDMP:  $u
  e. Merge in (N)SALV. For KA10: m$salv.  For KS10: m$nsalv bin
  f. Write the result to disk: dSnits.  It is prudent to make sure you write a new
     file name here. Use f$ for a file listing.

 - Timesharing DDT method

  a. Make a new job: its$j
  b. Load DDT without symbols: $1l .; @ DDT
  c. Merge in (N)SALV without symbols: For KA10: $$1l .; @ SALV. For KS10: $$1l .; NSALV BIN.
  d. Merge in ITS with symbols: $$l .; NITS BIN
  e. Write the result to disk: $y .; @ NITS

5.  If you're in DSKDMP and want to run ITS right away after dumping, it, type G$.
You're now in DDT and you can examine ITS, set breakpoints, etc. Type $g to start ITS.

6.  When the new ITS has passed testing, rename the old .; @ ITS to .; @ OITS.  Rename the
new ITS to .; @ ITS.
