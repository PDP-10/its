	RUNOFF is an EMACS macro
which facilitates managing text processing of large
text documents with multiple files.  It is built
upon the /TEXT option of the @ program (see INFO).
If you have an lrec file for your large text 
document then 

MM Runoff luser;thesis lrec

will run through all the files in the lrec and for
each compare the creation date of the XGP version
(which need no longer be online) with the current
">" version.  A list of :R commands will be accumulated
for all files that have changed since the last
time they were R'ed.  You will then be asked whether
you want to XXFILE the commands to re-R the 
appropriate files and then @ the whole mess to
get update pages on the XGP.  The TTY record
from XXFILE (containing e.g. error messages from R)
will be found in the file "LUSER;THESIS XXXOUT".

To obtain this macro MM LoadAI:EMACS;RUNOFF .

P.S. If you use TJ6 or PUB, you can use this macro
too!  The variable Runoff Command Template
holds the :R command into which the file names
are substituted.  You can make your own for other
text processors.
