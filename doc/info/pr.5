	PR -- FANCY FILE PRINTER -- 10/30/76 JMB


PR can be used to print files in a number of special ways.
Input is from some arbitrary file and output is normally
to the TTY.  However an output file may be specified.

In its simplest use, PR takes a file specification on its
JCL line in standard DDT-style format (including proper
handling of ^X, ^Y, and ^Q) and prints it as DDT would,
except that the screen is not cleared first.  Defaults for
the file names are taken from DDT but are not updated.

If a backarrow (underbar) appears in the JCL, output will
be to a file.  Defaults are taken from DDT as for the
input file and explicite names may be given before the
backarrow.  The I switch may still be used if output is
to some TTY but is not recommended for any other device.

PR's default actions may be modified by the use of switches.
A switch is a / followed a single switch name.  The switch
causes no actions (not even terminating a name) other than
toggling the appropriate bit, except as noted.

Switch		Action

  /C		Reading will continue past ^C's.

  /A		^@'s are not printed (good for reading
			partially binary files).

  /I		File will be printed in superimage mode with
			no MOREing and completely unaltered.
			Reading will not stop at ^C's.

  /P		Paged printing:  First the screen is cleared.
			Then at every ^L or ^_ a --MORE-- is
			done.  (This is good for mail or doc
			files.)

  /D		Ends current name, if any, and says that the
			next name read is a descriptor (see
			below).  Periods in this name are
			ignored.  The associated record will
			be printed.

  /L		Says that this is a doc file and causes
			its descriptor directory to be listed.




		SPECIAL ENTRIES TO PR



:DOC <type> <descriptor>	prints documentation from
					the doc file

<type> names the doc file and may currently be CALL, UUO, or
	USET.  The latest list will be printed by calling DOC
	with no arguments.

<descriptor> names the descriptor whose record should be
	printed.  Case is not important and periods will be
	ignored.  If this argument is omitted, the descriptor
	directory will be listed.

A doc file consists of a number of records separated by ^L's
and/or ^_'s.  Each record begins with a descriptor for that
record.  A descriptor is a string of upper-case letters and
digits up to six characters long (more are ignored).  It may
be preceded in the record by any non-legal characters.  When
a descriptor is found matching the one given, it is printed
followed by the rest of the record.  Note that DOC's actions
may be duplicated for any file in the right format by using
PR with the /D or /L switches.


{:CALL :UUO :USET :MUD(DLE)} act just like
:DOC {CALL UUO USET MUD(DLE)}, respectively.


LSC^K prints this week's LSC message (retrieved from DM).

NLSC^K prints next week's message.


:PRIM <file>	is used for transmitting keyboard macro
	information to an IMLAC.  It is the same as
	:PR <file>/I	except that it does nothing if
	the console is not an IMLAC and it tells the
	system that the cursor has moved to the top of
	the screen.  The latter action is necessary
	since allocating space for the keyboard macros
	causes the IMLAC to clear its screen.
