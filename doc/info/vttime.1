Description of the VTTIME program, last updated 2/7/78 -- BAK

VTTIME is a program for displaying the current time and/or elapsed time
since the program was started.  The information is printed and updated
periodically in the lower right hand corner of the screen.  The program was
written for VT52 terminals; it may or may not work on other display
terminals.

To use, simply invoke by "VTTIME^K" or ":VTTIME".  The current time will be
printed in the lower right corner of the screen, and will be updated every
10 seconds.

Other options can be invoked via JCL.  If the JCL consists of a number, this
is interpreted as the number of seconds to wait between updates.  It must be
a decimal integer containing no periods.  There are two optional switch
settings that may be specified:

B      (both) Display both time of day and elapsed time.
E      (elapsed) Display elapsed time only.

Switches are specified using a slash followed by the character in the JCL
line.

Examples:

:VTTIME
Displays time of day only and refreshes every 10 seconds.

:VTTIME 5
Displays time of day only and refreshes every 5 seconds.

:VTTIME 20 /B
Displays both time of day and elapsed time and refreshes every 20 seconds.

:VTTIME /E
Displays elapsed time only and refreshes every 10 seconds.


If both numbers and a switch setting are to be specified, the number must
proceed the switch setting.

The program does a :FORGET to DDT and will not appear in the job ring.  To
reown the job type VTTIMEJ at DDT.  The program will not in general run
under a non-DDT (due to VALRETting).
