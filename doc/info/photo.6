PHOTO is a simple program for capturing the output of a terminal
session.  Doing

    :PHOTO DSK:FRED;PHOTO OUTPUT

will open a STY and start a new job-tree who's TTY output is being
saved in the named file.  A consequence of starting up a new tree like
this is that the first thing you will have to do is to log in.  (It is
as if you were using supdup or telnet to hop right back to your own
machine.)

The characteristics of the terminal seen by the created job-tree will
be those of a printing terminal.  Since you are making a file
containing all of the output sent to that terminal, it is generally
not useful or desirable to try and change this.  (Thus if your login
init offers to set your terminal type to something else, you should
decline.)

By default PHOTO names its output file .PHOTO > in your working
directory.

The PHOTO escape character is Control-^ on terminals without a real Break
key (most terminals), or Break on terminals with a Break key (Knight TVs,
Lisp Machines, etc.).  (Note that on a Lisp Machine the Break key is
labeled "Suspend".)  The things you can type after the escape character
are:

^Z - do a local control-Z - return to DDT.
^_ - do a local control-_ - begin terminal escape command.
F  - stop or resume sending output to photo file.
P  - return to DDT, :PROCEED the PHOTO (run it without the TTY).
Q  - closes the STY and kills the PHOTO, detaching any foreign job-tree.
L  - closes the STY and kills the PHOTO, logging out any foreign job-tree.
?  - types this help message.
C  - changes the PHOTO escape character.  Follow by new escape char.
<PHOTO Escape Character>  - sends the character through.
