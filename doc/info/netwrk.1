This file attempts to describe various computer networks of two types --
those to which ITS systems are directly connected, and those which are of
interest to the ITS user community because they link up personal computers or
research institutions that are not accessible by the first kind of network.
There are two networks to which ITS machines are connected: the ARPANet and
the Chaosnet.  These networks support file transfer, mail, remote login, and
other services -- they may appear to be quite similar to the user, but have
differing implementations.  All the other networks documented herein are
mostly for mail and file transfer.

Internet

The Internet is a very large computer network that connects various
educational, military, and commericial establishments, all involved in some
way in computer science research.  It is actually a ``catenet'' of many
computer networks that run a protocol, the Internet Protocol, to allow
packets to be sent from one host to another, possibly through several other
networks.  An accompanying protocol called TCP provides a reliable byte
stream that programs can use, thus ignoring data errors and all the other
nitty-gritty details involved in getting a packet from here to there.

The ARPANet is perhaps the most famous of the Internet networks.  It
stretches from Massachusetts to Stanford.  Before the days of Internet, it
ran a protocol called NCP, which, unfortunately, was beginning to show its
age.  (The ARPANet is at least ten years old.)  Because the net had ceased to
become a research project, turning into a heavily-used resource, it was
decided that it would be interesting, now that a long-haul network was shown
feasible, to try to connect various networks together.  Then the hosts on
these networks, all differing in one characteristic or another, could talk to
each other without having to contact special hosts that would translate one
high-level protocol into another.  IP came out of this desire.  (In a false
start, all the internetwork issues were going to be resolved in the TCP
layer, but the details were wisely factored out.)  So the ARPANet become
``just another'' network in the Internet, although it still carries most of
the long-distance traffic.

When the switch from ARPAnet to Internet in software was made, it was a
cataclysm underneath, but the user could not notice much.  Most of the
high-level protocols used in the NCP days were simply carried over: Telnet,
SUPDUP (where it was implemented), FTP, and SMTP.  Some ITS user programs
contain commands to switch from TCP to NCP mode, though this is not usually
required.

At MIT, Internet appears in a variety of ways.  First, there is the ARPANet.
The second type of network to embrace IP was the LCS/Pronet Ring net.  The
main users of these networks are the LCS VAXes and many of the Athena
machines.  Thirdly, there are Ethernets at Tech Square who run IP, usually
along with Chaosnet.  The users of this mode include some VAXes at the AI
Lab, and some LCS machines.  And last, but not least, the Chaosnet can also
support Internet (after much heated discussion).  A few Unix machines have
taken this option.

As for the ITS machines, they all connect to the Internet through their
ARPANet IMPs.  The Internet host tables can be found in SYSENG; HSTNIC >
ITS implements both server and user programs for FTP, TELNET, and SUPDUP.
The MLDEV is also supported.  There is also an SMTP (mail) server.  Sources
for various TCP-related programs can be found in the TCP; directory on MC.
For programmers, there is a quick rundown of the ITS TCP interface (and
documentation that applies to network system calls in general) in
TCP;TCPDOC >  The network status can be checked with the PEEK program.

CHAOS

The Chaosnet was developed at the MIT AI lab as a local network to allows
Lisp Machines (CADRs, specifically) to access files on AI and MC.  Its
success caused it to become the most widely used local network at MIT.  The
following operation systems have support Chaosnet: LispM, ITS, Twenex, Tenex,
Unix, Multics, VMS, Seconds, MINITS, and MOS.  The last three are used
mainly in terminal concentrators and bridges.  Chaosnet has also been used at
Yale, TI, and many other Lisp Machine installations.  The definitive Chaosnet
documentation can be found in AI Memo 628, ``Chaosnet,'' by David Moon.

Chaosnet started out being supported by special Chaosnet hardware, but is now
mostly used with Ethernet II hardware.  Leased serial lines and microwave
links have also been used to run Chaosnet.  It is stressed that Chaosnet is
local network, but it has been used with some success transcontinentally.

On ITS, most programs (except FINGER) will automatically chose to use the
Chaosnet.  Here is a list of current user and server programs:

Service		Protocol	User		Server
--------------------------------------------------------------
Remote Login	TELNET		:TELNET		yes
		SUPDUP		:SUPDUP		yes
File Access	FILE		:CFTP		yes
Mail		MAIL		(COMSAT)	yes
		SMTP		(COMSAT)	yes
TTY send	SEND		:SEND		yes
		CONVERSE

There are also the usual servers for HOSTAB, TIME, UPTIME, and STATUS.  All
ITS machines offer a TCP server as well -- it allows Chaosnet hosts to
contact Internet hosts at a specified port number.  There is also a GMSGS
server and a LIMERICK server.

For contacting a host at an arbitary contact name, use

	:MOON;CHARFC host contact

The K PEEK mode will show that status of the Chaosnet.
