                                 Creating a new WL

	WL^S
Assemble new REL:
	:FAIL WL
If necessary, assemble new BOARDS file
	WL$$^S
	:FAIL WBOARD
Load binary:
	:STINK WL		;Uses WL LOADER
Merge in DECUUO boot:
	1L DECSYS;DECBOT BIN
	.JBSA/	STRT
	56/	107		;SAIL + META + SYMS + ...

	:DELETE DATDRW;NODIPS OBIN
	:RENAME DATDRW;NODIPS BIN, NODIPS OBIN
	:PDUMP  DATDRW;NODIPS BIN	; This is the file linked to by SYS1;TS NODIPS
	:GO
	"TOP MODE"
	XRESIDENT		;read in NDIPS.DIP and dump it out

This should produce a new WL;WL BIN which should be copied or moved to
DATDRW;

NOTE!! Don't save a WL OBIN! This can cause a complete screw if
someone later tries to "restore" this version, because it will
contain an old NDIPS DIP file, and the next dip creation/modification
cycle will clobber any dip definitions made since the WL OBIN.
