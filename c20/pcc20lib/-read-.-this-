MRFORT::MSC:<C.PCC20LIB>

This directory contains the library needed to run C programs generated
by the 'new' C compiler (PCC20).

If the output from the compiler is in STINKR format, then the directions
in <C> PCC20.HLP & CC.HLP are correct;

@stinkr
=x clib:stdio
=l myfile
=l alsomyfile
=o myfile.exe
=q

If your output files were produced in REL format use LINK or SLINK

@LINK
*/NOLOC MYFILE.STK....
*CLIB:CLIB.REL/SEA
*/G

** important **

If your program does not use 'standard' or 'portable' I/O, you may
have to load the start module (C20RUN) by hand before the search.

To create CLIB.REL, you must DO CLIB.MIC
