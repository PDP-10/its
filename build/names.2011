; Gateways and bug host. To set a value, use (EQV-LIST @host), where
;   host is a known host name, or an (octal) Chaosnet address, or
;   an IP address such as 192.168.1.1. Remember the @, and
;   NOTE that the address must belong to a host in SYSTEM;H3TEXT.
; *COMSAT-TCP-GATEWAY sets TCPGAT, which is used for all non-Chaosnet mail.
(*COMSAT-TCP-GATEWAY (EQV-LIST @%GW%))
; *COMSAT-DOMAIN-GATEWAY sets DOMGAT, which is used as a relay
;   for all unknown hostnames.
(*COMSAT-DOMAIN-GATEWAY (EQV-LIST @%GW%))
; *COMSAT-BUGHOST sets BUGHST: where to send BUG mail which isn't specified 
;   below. Default is the local host.
; *COMSAT-HEADER-GATEWAY sets HDRGAT, which is used in headers to create
;   user%host@HDRGAT headers on outgoing mail through relays.
; *COMSAT-GATEWAY-HOST sets GATHST which is used to set the default
;   HDRGAT, TCPGAT, and DOMGAT for Chaos-only hosts. It has no effect on
;   Internet-connected hosts. It's better to set the entries above explicitly.
