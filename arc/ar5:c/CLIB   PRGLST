; This file is a Stinkr XFILE that lists the program files that make up the
; shared C library.  It is used in the construction of a new library.  It
; is also used to construct test versions of programs not using the shared
; library and to construct timing versions of programs (which cannot use
; the shared library).

; The following are ITS- dependent files from C10LIB:

l c;c10cor
l c;c10exp
l c;c10fd
l c;c10fil
l c;c10fnm
l c;c10fo
l c;c10int
