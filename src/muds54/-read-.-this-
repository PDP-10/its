These files (probably) aren't historically accurate. They were
reconstructed in 2020 from partial Muddle 54/104 binaries and several
other versions of the source code, to make it possible to run Muddle 54
images.

Instructions that were obviously patched in the binaries are marked with
XXX in the source.
