FASLREA is a package of functions for reading s-expressions and other
information from a FASL file (see also FASDMP).  The source is MC:RLB;FASLRE >.

 The three main functions are:

 (FASLREADOPEN <file spec>) which opens the file, initializes, and
 	returns a FASL-OBJ for use by FASLREAD and FASLREADCLOSE.
 (FASLREAD <FASL-obj>) which reads an item and returns it, with a type code
 	consed onto its front:
 	EVAL  - the item was an "EVAL Mungeable". The CDR is the item.
 	ENTRY - the CDR is (<subr name> <subr type> <args prop>)
 	EOF   - the end of the FASL file was reached.
 (FASLREADCLOSE <FASL-obj>) which closes the file and flushes all
 	associated arrays.
 
 An additional function (QFASLREAD <fas-obj>) reads an object and returns
	it, with a code consed on its front:
	ENTRY - the CDR is the subr name
	EXT   - the CDR is the symbol subject to the call
	EOF   - the end of the FASL file was reached.

 DDT symbols are needed for the following LAP symbols:
	BNCONS
 In Lisp versions > /1567, DDT symbols won't be needed.

 IMPLEMENTATION --
 
 A FASL-OBJ is a Lisp T-type array with 6 entries:
 (0) is byte-obj, a Lisp FIXNUM array with 9. entries storing the 
     relocation bytes
 (1) is index indicating current (next) relocation type byte
 (2) is Newio file object
 (3) is the atom table, a Lisp T-type array
 (4) is the maximum subscript for the atom table (1- size)
 (5) is the greatest used subscript in the atom table.
