You should think of an animal, and I will try to guess what it is.  I
can accept multiple word responses, and I will read your input until I
see a period, exclam, or question mark (unless otherwise noted by the
'(Y OR N)' flag). I'll try to understand input in whatever form you
are comfortable with. As long as you use complete sentences, I should be
fine. Experiment if you want, I'm not as dumb as I may occasionally seem!
If you are not sure of what to do at any time, type a "?" or ask me a
question and I can probably help you.
