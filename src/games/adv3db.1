2	DOWN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HILL.  THERE IS A BUILDING IN THE DISTANCE.
3	YOU ARE INSIDE A BUILDING, A WELL HOUSE FOR A LARGE SPRING.
4	YOU ARE IN A VALLEY IN THE FOREST BESIDE A STREAM TUMBLING ALONG A
4	ROCKY BED.
5	YOU ARE IN OPEN FOREST, WITH A DEEP VALLEY TO ONE SIDE.
6	YOU ARE IN OPEN FOREST NEAR BOTH A VALLEY AND A ROAD.
7	AT YOUR FEET ALL THE WATER OF THE STREAM SPLASHES INTO A 2-INCH SLIT
7	IN THE ROCK.  DOWNSTREAM THE STREAMBED IS BARE ROCK.
8	YOU ARE IN A 20-FOOT DEPRESSION FLOORED WITH BARE DIRT.  SET INTO THE
8	DIRT IS A STRONG STEEL GRATE MOUNTED IN CONCRETE.  A DRY STREAMBED
8	LEADS INTO THE DEPRESSION.
9	YOU ARE IN A SMALL CHAMBER BENEATH A 3X3 STEEL GRATE TO THE SURFACE.
9	A LOW CRAWL OVER COBBLES LEADS INWARD TO THE WEST.
10	YOU ARE CRAWLING OVER COBBLES IN A LOW PASSAGE.  THERE IS A DIM LIGHT
10	AT THE EAST END OF THE PASSAGE.
11	YOU ARE IN A DEBRIS ROOM FILLED WITH STUFF WASHED IN FROM THE SURFACE.
11	A LOW WIDE PASSAGE WITH COBBLES BECOMES PLUGGED WITH MUD AND DEBRIS
11	HERE, BUT AN AWKWARD CANYON LEADS UPWARD AND WEST.  A NOTE ON THE WALL
11	SAYS "MAGIC WORD XYZZY".
12	YOU ARE IN AN AWKWARD SLOPING EAST/WEST CANYON.
13	YOU ARE IN A SPLENDID CHAMBER THIRTY FEET HIGH.  THE WALLS ARE FROZEN
13	RIVERS OF ORANGE STONE.  AN AWKWARD CANYON AND A GOOD PASSAGE EXIT
13	FROM EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE CHAMBER.
14	AT YOUR FEET IS A SMALL PIT BREATHING TRACES OF WHITE MIST.  AN EAST
14	PASSAGE ENDS HERE EXCEPT FOR A SMALL CRACK LEADING ON.
15	YOU ARE AT ONE END OF A VAST HALL STRETCHING FORWARD OUT OF SIGHT TO
15	THE WEST.  THERE ARE OPENINGS TO EITHER SIDE.  NEARBY, A WIDE STONE
15	STAIRCASE LEADS DOWNWARD.  THE HALL IS FILLED WITH WISPS OF WHITE MIST
15	SWAYING TO AND FRO ALMOST AS IF ALIVE.  A COLD WIND BLOWS UP THE
15	STAIRCASE.  THERE IS A PASSAGE AT THE TOP OF A DOME BEHIND YOU.
16	THE CRACK IS FAR TOO SMALL FOR YOU TO FOLLOW.
17	YOU ARE ON THE EAST BANK OF A FISSURE SLICING CLEAR ACROSS THE HALL.
17	THE MIST IS QUITE THICK HERE, AND THE FISSURE IS TOO WIDE TO JUMP.
18	THIS IS A LOW ROOM WITH A CRUDE NOTE ON THE WALL.  THE NOTE SAYS,
18	"YOU WON'T GET IT UP THE STEPS".
19	YOU ARE IN THE HALL OF THE MOUNTAIN KING, WITH PASSAGES OFF IN ALL
19	DIRECTIONS.

33	A ROCK IN THE ROOM'S CENTER.
34	YOU ARE IN A JUMBLE OF ROCK, WITH CRACKS EVERYWHERE.
35	YOU'RE AT A LOW WINDOW OVERLOOKING A HUGE PIT, WHICH EXTENDS UP OUT OF
35	SIGHT.  A FLOOR IS INDISTINCTLY VISIBLE OVER 50 FEET BELOW.  TRACES OF
35	WHITE MIST COVER THE FLOOR OF THE PIT, BECOMING THICKER TO THE RIGHT.
35	MARKS IN THE DUST AROUND THE WINDOW WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT
35	SOMEONE HAS BEEN HERE RECENTLY.  DIRECTLY ACROSS THE PIT FROM YOU AND
35	25 FEET AWAY THERE IS A SIMILAR WINDOW LOOKING INTO A LIGHTED ROOM.  A
35	SHADOWY FIGURE CAN BE SEEN THERE PEERING BACK AT YOU.
36	YOU ARE IN A DIRTY BROKEN PASSAGE.  TO THE EAST IS A CRAWL.  TO THE
36	WEST IS A LARGE PASSAGE.  ABOVE YOU IS A HOLE TO ANOTHER PASSAGE.
37	YOU ARE ON THE BRINK OF A SMALL CLEAN CLIMBABLE PIT.  A CRAWL LEADS
37	WEST.
38	YOU ARE IN THE BOTTOM OF A SMALL PIT WITH A LITTLE STREAM, WHICH
38	ENTERS AND EXITS THROUGH TINY SLITS.
39	YOU ARE IN A LARGE ROOM FULL OF DUSTY ROCKS.  THERE IS A BIG HOLE IN
39	THE FLOOR.  THERE ARE CRACKS EVERYWHERE, AND A PASSAGE LEADING EAST.
40	YOU HAVE CRAWLED THROUGH A VERY LOW WIDE PASSAGE PARALLEL TO AND NORTH
40	OF THE HALL OF MISTS.
41	YOU ARE AT THE WEST END OF HALL OF MISTS.  A LOW WIDE CRAWL CONTINUES

66	GO WEST, EAST, NE, AND NW.  PART OF THE ROOM IS OCCUPIED BY A LARGE
66	BEDROCK BLOCK.
67	YOU ARE AT THE EAST END OF THE TWOPIT ROOM.  THE FLOOR HERE IS
67	LITTERED WITH THIN ROCK SLABS, WHICH MAKE IT EASY TO DESCEND THE PITS.
67	THERE IS A PATH HERE BYPASSING THE PITS TO CONNECT PASSAGES FROM EAST
67	AND WEST.  THERE ARE HOLES ALL OVER, BUT THE ONLY BIG ONE IS ON THE
67	WALL DIRECTLY OVER THE WEST PIT WHERE YOU CAN'T GET TO IT.
68	YOU ARE IN A LARGE LOW CIRCULAR CHAMBER WHOSE FLOOR IS AN IMMENSE SLAB
68	FALLEN FROM THE CEILING (SLAB ROOM).  EAST AND WEST THERE ONCE WERE
68	LARGE PASSAGES, BUT THEY ARE NOW FILLED WITH BOULDERS.  LOW SMALL

88	PROFUSION OF LEAVES.
89	THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO CLIMB.  USE "UP" OR "OUT" TO LEAVE THE PIT.
90	YOU HAVE CLIMBED UP THE PLANT AND OUT OF THE PIT.
91	YOU ARE AT THE TOP OF A STEEP INCLINE ABOVE A LARGE ROOM.  YOU COULD
91	CLIMB DOWN HERE, BUT YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CLIMB UP.  THERE IS A
91	PASSAGE LEADING BACK TO THE NORTH.
92	YOU ARE IN THE GIANT ROOM.  THE CEILING HERE IS TOO HIGH UP FOR YOUR
92	LAMP TO SHOW IT.  CAVERNOUS PASSAGES LEAD EAST, NORTH, AND SOUTH.  ON
92	THE WEST WALL IS SCRAWLED THE INSCRIPTION, "FEE FIE FOE FOO" [SIC].
93	THE PASSAGE HERE IS BLOCKED BY A RECENT CAVE-IN.
94	YOU ARE AT ONE END OF AN IMMENSE NORTH/SOUTH PASSAGE.
95	YOU ARE IN A MAGNIFICENT CAVERN WITH A RUSHING STREAM, WHICH CASCADES
95	OVER A SPARKLING WATERFALL INTO A ROARING WHIRLPOOL WHICH DISAPPEARS
95	THROUGH A HOLE IN THE FLOOR.  PASSAGES EXIT TO THE SOUTH AND WEST.
96	YOU ARE IN THE SOFT ROOM.  THE WALLS ARE COVERED WITH HEAVY CURTAINS,
96	THE FLOOR WITH A THICK PILE CARPET.  MOSS COVERS THE CEILING.
97	THIS IS THE ORIENTAL ROOM.  ANCIENT ORIENTAL CAVE DRAWINGS COVER THE
97	WALLS.  A GENTLY SLOPING PASSAGE LEADS UPWARD TO THE NORTH, ANOTHER
97	PASSAGE LEADS SE, AND A HANDS AND KNEES CRAWL LEADS WEST.
98	YOU ARE FOLLOWING A WIDE PATH AROUND THE OUTER EDGE OF A LARGE CAVERN.
98	FAR BELOW, THROUGH A HEAVY WHITE MIST, STRANGE SPLASHING NOISES CAN BE
98	HEARD.  THE MIST RISES UP THROUGH A FISSURE IN THE CEILING.  THE PATH
98	EXITS TO THE SOUTH AND WEST.
99	YOU ARE IN AN ALCOVE.  A SMALL NW PATH SEEMS TO WIDEN AFTER A SHORT
99	DISTANCE.  AN EXTREMELY TIGHT TUNNEL LEADS EAST.  IT LOOKS LIKE A VERY
99	TIGHT SQUEEZE.  AN EERIE LIGHT CAN BE SEEN AT THE OTHER END.
100	YOU'RE IN A SMALL CHAMBER LIT BY AN EERIE GREEN LIGHT.  AN EXTREMELY
100	NARROW TUNNEL EXITS TO THE WEST.  A DARK CORRIDOR LEADS NE.
101	YOU'RE IN THE DARK-ROOM.  A CORRIDOR LEADING SOUTH IS THE ONLY EXIT.
102	YOU ARE IN AN ARCHED HALL.  A CORAL PASSAGE ONCE CONTINUED UP AND EAST
102	FROM HERE, BUT IS NOW BLOCKED BY DEBRIS.  THE AIR SMELLS OF SEA WATER.
103	YOU'RE IN A LARGE ROOM CARVED OUT OF SEDIMENTARY ROCK.  THE FLOOR AND
103	WALLS ARE LITTERED WITH BITS OF SHELLS IMBEDDED IN THE STONE.  A
103	SHALLOW PASSAGE PROCEEDS DOWNWARD, AND A SOMEWHAT STEEPER ONE LEADS
103	UP.  A LOW HANDS AND KNEES PASSAGE ENTERS FROM THE SOUTH.
104	YOU ARE IN A LONG SLOPING CORRIDOR WITH RAGGED SHARP WALLS.
105	YOU ARE IN A CUL-DE-SAC ABOUT EIGHT FEET ACROSS.
106	YOU ARE IN AN ANTEROOM LEADING TO A LARGE PASSAGE TO THE EAST.  SMALL
106	PASSAGES GO WEST AND UP.  THE REMNANTS OF RECENT DIGGING ARE EVIDENT.
106	A SIGN IN MIDAIR HERE SAYS "CAVE UNDER CONSTRUCTION BEYOND THIS POINT.
106	PROCEED AT OWN RISK.  [WITT CONSTRUCTION COMPANY]"
107	YOU ARE IN A MAZE OF TWISTY LITTLE PASSAGES, ALL DIFFERENT.
108	YOU ARE AT WITT'S END.  PASSAGES LEAD OFF IN *ALL* DIRECTIONS.
109	YOU ARE IN A NORTH/SOUTH CANYON ABOUT 25 FEET ACROSS.  THE FLOOR IS
109	COVERED BY WHITE MIST SEEPING IN FROM THE NORTH.  THE WALLS EXTEND
109	UPWARD FOR WELL OVER 100 FEET.  SUSPENDED FROM SOME UNSEEN POINT FAR
109	ABOVE YOU, AN ENORMOUS TWO-SIDED MIRROR IS HANGING PARALLEL TO AND
109	MIDWAY BETWEEN THE CANYON WALLS.  (THE MIRROR IS OBVIOUSLY PROVIDED
109	FOR THE USE OF THE DWARVES, WHO AS YOU KNOW, ARE EXTREMELY VAIN.)  A
109	SMALL WINDOW CAN BE SEEN IN EITHER WALL, SOME FIFTY FEET UP.
110	YOU'RE AT A LOW WINDOW OVERLOOKING A HUGE PIT, WHICH EXTENDS UP OUT OF
110	SIGHT.  A FLOOR IS INDISTINCTLY VISIBLE OVER 50 FEET BELOW.  TRACES OF
110	WHITE MIST COVER THE FLOOR OF THE PIT, BECOMING THICKER TO THE LEFT.
110	MARKS IN THE DUST AROUND THE WINDOW WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT
110	SOMEONE HAS BEEN HERE RECENTLY.  DIRECTLY ACROSS THE PIT FROM YOU AND
110	25 FEET AWAY THERE IS A SIMILAR WINDOW LOOKING INTO A LIGHTED ROOM.  A
110	SHADOWY FIGURE CAN BE SEEN THERE PEERING BACK AT YOU.
111	A LARGE STALACTITE EXTENDS FROM THE ROOF AND ALMOST REACHES THE FLOOR
111	BELOW.  YOU COULD CLIMB DOWN IT, AND JUMP FROM IT TO THE FLOOR, BUT
111	HAVING DONE SO YOU WOULD BE UNABLE TO REACH IT TO CLIMB BACK UP.
112	YOU ARE IN A LITTLE MAZE OF TWISTING PASSAGES, ALL DIFFERENT.
113	YOU ARE AT THE EDGE OF A LARGE UNDERGROUND RESERVOIR.  AN OPAQUE CLOUD
113	OF WHITE MIST FILLS THE ROOM AND RISES RAPIDLY UPWARD.  THE LAKE IS
113	FED BY A STREAM, WHICH TUMBLES OUT OF A HOLE IN THE WALL ABOUT 10 FEET
113	OVERHEAD AND SPLASHES NOISILY INTO THE WATER SOMEWHERE WITHIN THE
113	MIST.  THE ONLY PASSAGE GOES BACK TOWARD THE SOUTH.
114	DEAD END
115	YOU ARE AT THE NORTHEAST END OF AN IMMENSE ROOM, EVEN LARGER THAN THE
115	GIANT ROOM.  IT APPEARS TO BE A REPOSITORY FOR THE "ADVENTURE"
115	PROGRAM.  MASSIVE TORCHES FAR OVERHEAD BATHE THE ROOM WITH SMOKY
115	YELLOW LIGHT.  SCATTERED ABOUT YOU CAN BE SEEN A PILE OF BOTTLES (ALL
115	OF THEM EMPTY), A NURSERY OF YOUNG BEANSTALKS MURMURING QUIETLY, A BED
115	OF OYSTERS, A BUNDLE OF BLACK RODS WITH RUSTY STARS ON THEIR ENDS, AND
115	A COLLECTION OF BRASS LANTERNS.  OFF TO ONE SIDE A GREAT MANY DWARVES
115	ARE SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR, SNORING LOUDLY.  A SIGN NEARBY READS: "DO
115	NOT DISTURB THE DWARVES!"  AN IMMENSE MIRROR IS HANGING AGAINST ONE
115	WALL, AND STRETCHES TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM, WHERE VARIOUS OTHER
115	SUNDRY OBJECTS CAN BE GLIMPSED DIMLY IN THE DISTANCE.
116	YOU ARE AT THE SOUTHWEST END OF THE REPOSITORY.  TO ONE SIDE IS A PIT
116	FULL OF FIERCE GREEN SNAKES.  ON THE OTHER SIDE IS A ROW OF SMALL
116	WICKER CAGES, EACH OF WHICH CONTAINS A LITTLE SULKING BIRD.  IN ONE
116	CORNER IS A BUNDLE OF BLACK RODS WITH RUSTY MARKS ON THEIR ENDS.  A
116	LARGE NUMBER OF VELVET PILLOWS ARE SCATTERED ABOUT ON THE FLOOR.  A
116	VAST MIRROR STRETCHES OFF TO THE NORTHEAST.  AT YOUR FEET IS A LARGE
116	STEEL GRATE, NEXT TO WHICH IS A SIGN WHICH READS, "TREASURE VAULT.
116	KEYS IN MAIN OFFICE."
117	YOU ARE ON ONE SIDE OF A LARGE, DEEP CHASM.  A HEAVY WHITE MIST RISING
117	UP FROM BELOW OBSCURES ALL VIEW OF THE FAR SIDE.  A SW PATH LEADS AWAY
117	FROM THE CHASM INTO A WINDING CORRIDOR.
118	YOU ARE IN A LONG WINDING CORRIDOR SLOPING OUT OF SIGHT IN BOTH
118	DIRECTIONS.
119	YOU ARE IN A SECRET CANYON WHICH EXITS TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
120	YOU ARE IN A SECRET CANYON WHICH EXITS TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
121	YOU ARE IN A SECRET CANYON WHICH EXITS TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
122	YOU ARE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE CHASM.  A NE PATH LEADS AWAY FROM THE
122	CHASM ON THIS SIDE.
123	YOU'RE IN A LONG EAST/WEST CORRIDOR.  A FAINT RUMBLING NOISE CAN BE
123	HEARD IN THE DISTANCE.
124	THE PATH FORKS HERE.  THE LEFT FORK LEADS NORTHEAST.  A DULL RUMBLING
124	SEEMS TO GET LOUDER IN THAT DIRECTION.  THE RIGHT FORK LEADS SOUTHEAST
124	DOWN A GENTLE SLOPE.  THE MAIN CORRIDOR ENTERS FROM THE WEST.
125	THE WALLS ARE QUITE WARM HERE.  FROM THE NORTH CAN BE HEARD A STEADY
125	ROAR, SO LOUD THAT THE ENTIRE CAVE SEEMS TO BE TREMBLING.  ANOTHER
125	PASSAGE LEADS SOUTH, AND A LOW CRAWL GOES EAST.
126	YOU ARE ON THE EDGE OF A BREATH-TAKING VIEW.  FAR BELOW YOU IS AN
126	ACTIVE VOLCANO, FROM WHICH GREAT GOUTS OF MOLTEN LAVA COME SURGING
126	OUT, CASCADING BACK DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS.  THE GLOWING ROCK FILLS THE
126	FARTHEST REACHES OF THE CAVERN WITH A BLOOD-RED GLARE, GIVING EVERY-
126	THING AN EERIE, MACABRE APPEARANCE.  THE AIR IS FILLED WITH FLICKERING
126	SPARKS OF ASH AND A HEAVY SMELL OF BRIMSTONE.  THE WALLS ARE HOT TO
126	THE TOUCH, AND THE THUNDERING OF THE VOLCANO DROWNS OUT ALL OTHER
126	SOUNDS.  EMBEDDED IN THE JAGGED ROOF FAR OVERHEAD ARE MYRIAD TWISTED
126	FORMATIONS COMPOSED OF PURE WHITE ALABASTER, WHICH SCATTER THE MURKY
126	LIGHT INTO SINISTER APPARITIONS UPON THE WALLS.  TO ONE SIDE IS A DEEP
126	GORGE, FILLED WITH A BIZARRE CHAOS OF TORTURED ROCK WHICH SEEMS TO
126	HAVE BEEN CRAFTED BY THE DEVIL HIMSELF.  AN IMMENSE RIVER OF FIRE
126	CRASHES OUT FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE VOLCANO, BURNS ITS WAY THROUGH THE
126	GORGE, AND PLUMMETS INTO A BOTTOMLESS PIT FAR OFF TO YOUR LEFT.  TO
126	THE RIGHT, AN IMMENSE GEYSER OF BLISTERING STEAM ERUPTS CONTINUOUSLY
126	FROM A BARREN ISLAND IN THE CENTER OF A SULFUROUS LAKE, WHICH BUBBLES
126	OMINOUSLY.  THE FAR RIGHT WALL IS AFLAME WITH AN INCANDESCENCE OF ITS
126	OWN, WHICH LENDS AN ADDITIONAL INFERNAL SPLENDOR TO THE ALREADY
126	HELLISH SCENE.  A DARK, FOREBODING PASSAGE EXITS TO THE SOUTH.
127	YOU ARE IN A SMALL CHAMBER FILLED WITH LARGE BOULDERS.  THE WALLS ARE
127	VERY WARM, CAUSING THE AIR IN THE ROOM TO BE ALMOST STIFLING FROM THE
127	HEAT.  THE ONLY EXIT IS A CRAWL HEADING WEST, THROUGH WHICH IS COMING
127	A LOW RUMBLING.
128	YOU ARE WALKING ALONG A GENTLY SLOPING NORTH/SOUTH PASSAGE LINED WITH
128	ODDLY SHAPED LIMESTONE FORMATIONS.
129	YOU ARE STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE TO A LARGE, BARREN ROOM.  A SIGN
129	POSTED ABOVE THE ENTRANCE READS:  "CAUTION!  BEAR IN ROOM!"
130	YOU ARE INSIDE A BARREN ROOM.  THE CENTER OF THE ROOM IS COMPLETELY
130	EMPTY EXCEPT FOR SOME DUST.  MARKS IN THE DUST LEAD AWAY TOWARD THE
130	FAR END OF THE ROOM.  THE ONLY EXIT IS THE WAY YOU CAME IN.

1	SOMEWHERE NEARBY IS COLOSSAL CAVE, WHERE OTHERS HAVE FOUND FORTUNES IN
1	TREASURE AND GOLD, THOUGH IT IS RUMORED THAT SOME WHO ENTER ARE NEVER
1	SEEN AGAIN.  MAGIC IS SAID TO WORK IN THE CAVE.  I WILL BE YOUR EYES
1	AND HANDS.  DIRECT ME WITH COMMANDS OF 1 OR 2 WORDS.  I SHOULD WARN
1	YOU THAT I LOOK AT ONLY THE FIRST FIVE LETTERS OF EACH WORD, SO YOU'LL
1	HAVE TO ENTER "NORTHEAST" AS "NE" TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM "NORTH".
1	(SHOULD YOU GET STUCK, TYPE "HELP" FOR SOME GENERAL HINTS.  FOR INFOR-
1	MATION ON HOW TO END YOUR ADVENTURE, ETC., TYPE "INFO".)
1				      - - -
1	THIS PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED BY WILLIE CROWTHER.  MOST OF THE
1	FEATURES OF THE CURRENT PROGRAM WERE ADDED BY DON WOODS (DON @ SU-AI).
1	CONTACT DON IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, COMMENTS, ETC.
2	A LITTLE DWARF WITH A BIG KNIFE BLOCKS YOUR WAY.
3	A LITTLE DWARF JUST WALKED AROUND A CORNER, SAW YOU, THREW A LITTLE
3	AXE AT YOU WHICH MISSED, CURSED, AND RAN AWAY.
4	THERE IS A THREATENING LITTLE DWARF IN THE ROOM WITH YOU!
5	ONE SHARP NASTY KNIFE IS THROWN AT YOU!
6	NONE OF THEM HIT YOU!
7	ONE OF THEM GETS YOU!
8	A HOLLOW VOICE SAYS "PLUGH".
9	THERE IS NO WAY TO GO THAT DIRECTION.
10	I AM UNSURE HOW YOU ARE FACING.  USE COMPASS POINTS OR NEARBY OBJECTS.
11	I DON'T KNOW IN FROM OUT HERE.  USE COMPASS POINTS OR NAME SOMETHING
11	IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO.
12	I DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPLY THAT WORD HERE.
13	I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT!
14	I'M GAME.  WOULD YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN HOW?
15	SORRY, BUT I AM NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE MORE DETAIL.  I WILL REPEAT THE
15	LONG DESCRIPTION OF YOUR LOCATION.
16	IT IS NOW PITCH DARK.  IF YOU PROCEED YOU WILL LIKELY FALL INTO A PIT.
17	IF YOU PREFER, SIMPLY TYPE W RATHER THAN WEST.
18	ARE YOU TRYING TO CATCH THE BIRD?
19	THE BIRD IS FRIGHTENED RIGHT NOW AND YOU CANNOT CATCH IT NO MATTER
19	WHAT YOU TRY.  PERHAPS YOU MIGHT TRY LATER.
20	ARE YOU TRYING TO SOMEHOW DEAL WITH THE SNAKE?
21	YOU CAN'T KILL THE SNAKE, OR DRIVE IT AWAY, OR AVOID IT, OR ANYTHING
21	LIKE THAT.  THERE IS A WAY TO GET BY, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE NECESSARY
21	RESOURCES RIGHT NOW.
22	DO YOU REALLY WANT TO QUIT NOW?
23	YOU FELL INTO A PIT AND BROKE EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY!
24	YOU ARE ALREADY CARRYING IT!
25	YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!
26	THE BIRD WAS UNAFRAID WHEN YOU ENTERED, BUT AS YOU APPROACH IT BECOMES
26	DISTURBED AND YOU CANNOT CATCH IT.
27	YOU CAN CATCH THE BIRD, BUT YOU CANNOT CARRY IT.
28	THERE IS NOTHING HERE WITH A LOCK!
29	YOU AREN'T CARRYING IT!
30	THE LITTLE BIRD ATTACKS THE GREEN SNAKE, AND IN AN ASTOUNDING FLURRY
30	DRIVES THE SNAKE AWAY.
31	YOU HAVE NO KEYS!
32	IT HAS NO LOCK.
33	I DON'T KNOW HOW TO LOCK OR UNLOCK SUCH A THING.
34	IT WAS ALREADY LOCKED.
35	THE GRATE IS NOW LOCKED.
36	THE GRATE IS NOW UNLOCKED.
37	IT WAS ALREADY UNLOCKED.
38	YOU HAVE NO SOURCE OF LIGHT.
39	YOUR LAMP IS NOW ON.
40	YOUR LAMP IS NOW OFF.
41	THERE IS NO WAY TO GET PAST THE BEAR TO UNLOCK THE CHAIN, WHICH IS
41	PROBABLY JUST AS WELL.
42	NOTHING HAPPENS.
43	WHERE?
44	THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO ATTACK.
45	THE LITTLE BIRD IS NOW DEAD.  ITS BODY DISAPPEARS.
46	ATTACKING THE SNAKE BOTH DOESN'T WORK AND IS VERY DANGEROUS.
47	YOU KILLED A LITTLE DWARF.
48	YOU ATTACK A LITTLE DWARF, BUT HE DODGES OUT OF THE WAY.
49	WITH WHAT?  YOUR BARE HANDS?
50	GOOD TRY, BUT THAT IS AN OLD WORN-OUT MAGIC WORD.
51	I KNOW OF PLACES, ACTIONS, AND THINGS.  MOST OF MY VOCABULARY
51	DESCRIBES PLACES AND IS USED TO MOVE YOU THERE.  TO MOVE, TRY WORDS
51	LIKE FOREST, BUILDING, DOWNSTREAM, ENTER, EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH,
51	UP, OR DOWN.  I KNOW ABOUT A FEW SPECIAL OBJECTS, LIKE A BLACK ROD
51	HIDDEN IN THE CAVE.  THESE OBJECTS CAN BE MANIPULATED USING SOME OF
51	THE ACTION WORDS THAT I KNOW.  USUALLY YOU WILL NEED TO GIVE BOTH THE
51	OBJECT AND ACTION WORDS (IN EITHER ORDER), BUT SOMETIMES I CAN INFER
51	THE OBJECT FROM THE VERB ALONE.  SOME OBJECTS ALSO IMPLY VERBS; IN
51	PARTICULAR, "INVENTORY" IMPLIES "TAKE INVENTORY", WHICH CAUSES ME TO
51	GIVE YOU A LIST OF WHAT YOU'RE CARRYING.  THE OBJECTS HAVE SIDE
51	EFFECTS; FOR INSTANCE, THE ROD SCARES THE BIRD.  USUALLY PEOPLE HAVING
51	TROUBLE MOVING JUST NEED TO TRY A FEW MORE WORDS.  USUALLY PEOPLE
51	TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY TO MANIPULATE AN OBJECT ARE ATTEMPTING SOMETHING
51	BEYOND THEIR (OR MY!) CAPABILITIES AND SHOULD TRY A COMPLETELY
51	DIFFERENT TACK.  TO SPEED THE GAME YOU CAN SOMETIMES MOVE LONG
51	DISTANCES WITH A SINGLE WORD.  FOR EXAMPLE, "BUILDING" USUALLY GETS
51	YOU TO THE BUILDING FROM ANYWHERE ABOVE GROUND EXCEPT WHEN LOST IN THE
51	FOREST.  ALSO, NOTE THAT CAVE PASSAGES TURN A LOT, AND THAT LEAVING A
51	ROOM TO THE NORTH DOES NOT GUARANTEE ENTERING THE NEXT FROM THE SOUTH.
51	GOOD LUCK!
52	IT MISSES!
53	IT GETS YOU!
54	OK
55	YOU CAN'T UNLOCK THE KEYS.
56	YOU HAVE CRAWLED AROUND IN SOME LITTLE HOLES AND WOUND UP BACK IN THE
56	MAIN PASSAGE.
57	I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE CAVE IS, BUT HEREABOUTS NO STREAM CAN RUN ON
57	THE SURFACE FOR LONG.  I WOULD TRY THE STREAM.
58	I NEED MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS TO DO THAT.
59	I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT YOU SEE AS YOU MOVE ABOUT AND MANIPULATE
59	THINGS.  I CANNOT TELL YOU WHERE REMOTE THINGS ARE.
60	I DON'T KNOW THAT WORD.
61	WHAT?
62	ARE YOU TRYING TO GET INTO THE CAVE?
63	THE GRATE IS VERY SOLID AND HAS A HARDENED STEEL LOCK.  YOU CANNOT
63	ENTER WITHOUT A KEY, AND THERE ARE NO KEYS NEARBY.  I WOULD RECOMMEND
63	LOOKING ELSEWHERE FOR THE KEYS.
64	THE TREES OF THE FOREST ARE LARGE HARDWOOD OAK AND MAPLE, WITH AN
64	OCCASIONAL GROVE OF PINE OR SPRUCE.  THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF UNDER-
64	GROWTH, LARGELY BIRCH AND ASH SAPLINGS PLUS NONDESCRIPT BUSHES OF
64	VARIOUS SORTS.  THIS TIME OF YEAR VISIBILITY IS QUITE RESTRICTED BY
64	ALL THE LEAVES, BUT TRAVEL IS QUITE EASY IF YOU DETOUR AROUND THE
64	SPRUCE AND BERRY BUSHES.
65	WELCOME TO ADVENTURE!!  WOULD YOU LIKE INSTRUCTIONS?
66	DIGGING WITHOUT A SHOVEL IS QUITE IMPRACTICAL.  EVEN WITH A SHOVEL
66	PROGRESS IS UNLIKELY.
67	BLASTING REQUIRES DYNAMITE.
68	I'M AS CONFUSED AS YOU ARE.
69	MIST IS A WHITE VAPOR, USUALLY WATER, SEEN FROM TIME TO TIME IN
69	CAVERNS.  IT CAN BE FOUND ANYWHERE BUT IS FREQUENTLY A SIGN OF A DEEP
69	PIT LEADING DOWN TO WATER.
70	YOUR FEET ARE NOW WET.
71	I THINK I JUST LOST MY APPETITE.
72	THANK YOU, IT WAS DELICIOUS!
73	YOU HAVE TAKEN A DRINK FROM THE STREAM.  THE WATER TASTES STRONGLY OF
73	MINERALS, BUT IS NOT UNPLEASANT.  IT IS EXTREMELY COLD.
74	THE BOTTLE OF WATER IS NOW EMPTY.
75	RUBBING THE ELECTRIC LAMP IS NOT PARTICULARLY REWARDING.  ANYWAY,
75	NOTHING EXCITING HAPPENS.
76	PECULIAR.  NOTHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENS.
77	YOUR BOTTLE IS EMPTY AND THE GROUND IS WET.
78	YOU CAN'T POUR THAT.
79	WATCH IT!
80	WHICH WAY?
81	OH DEAR, YOU SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN YOURSELF KILLED.  I MIGHT BE ABLE TO
81	HELP YOU OUT, BUT I'VE NEVER REALLY DONE THIS BEFORE.  DO YOU WANT ME
81	TO TRY TO REINCARNATE YOU?
82	ALL RIGHT.  BUT DON'T BLAME ME IF SOMETHING GOES WR......
82	                    --- POOF!! ---
82	YOU ARE ENGULFED IN A CLOUD OF ORANGE SMOKE.  COUGHING AND GASPING,
82	YOU EMERGE FROM THE SMOKE AND FIND....
83	YOU CLUMSY OAF, YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN!  I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I CAN
83	KEEP THIS UP.  DO YOU WANT ME TO TRY REINCARNATING YOU AGAIN?
84	OKAY, NOW WHERE DID I PUT MY ORANGE SMOKE?....  >POOF!<
84	EVERYTHING DISAPPEARS IN A DENSE CLOUD OF ORANGE SMOKE.
85	NOW YOU'VE REALLY DONE IT!  I'M OUT OF ORANGE SMOKE!  YOU DON'T EXPECT
85	ME TO DO A DECENT REINCARNATION WITHOUT ANY ORANGE SMOKE, DO YOU?
86	OKAY, IF YOU'RE SO SMART, DO IT YOURSELF!  I'M LEAVING!
90	>>> MESSAGES 81 THRU 90 ARE RESERVED FOR "OBITUARIES". <<<
91	SORRY, BUT I NO LONGER SEEM TO REMEMBER HOW IT WAS YOU GOT HERE.
92	YOU CAN'T CARRY ANYTHING MORE.  YOU'LL HAVE TO DROP SOMETHING FIRST.
93	YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH A LOCKED STEEL GRATE!
94	I BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT IS RIGHT HERE WITH YOU.
95	YOU DON'T FIT THROUGH A TWO-INCH SLIT!
96	I RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST YOU GO ACROSS THE BRIDGE INSTEAD OF JUMPING.
97	THERE IS NO WAY ACROSS THE FISSURE.
98	YOU'RE NOT CARRYING ANYTHING.
99	YOU ARE CURRENTLY HOLDING THE FOLLOWING:
100	IT'S NOT HUNGRY (IT'S MERELY PININ' FOR THE FJORDS).  BESIDES, YOU
100	HAVE NO BIRD SEED.
101	THE SNAKE HAS NOW DEVOURED YOUR BIRD.
102	THERE'S NOTHING HERE IT WANTS TO EAT (EXCEPT PERHAPS YOU).
103	YOU FOOL, DWARVES EAT ONLY COAL!  NOW YOU'VE MADE HIM *REALLY* MAD!!
104	YOU HAVE NOTHING IN WHICH TO CARRY IT.
105	YOUR BOTTLE IS ALREADY FULL.
106	THERE IS NOTHING HERE WITH WHICH TO FILL THE BOTTLE.
107	YOUR BOTTLE IS NOW FULL OF WATER.
108	YOUR BOTTLE IS NOW FULL OF OIL.
109	YOU CAN'T FILL THAT.
110	DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!
111	THE DOOR IS EXTREMELY RUSTY AND REFUSES TO OPEN.
112	THE PLANT INDIGNANTLY SHAKES THE OIL OFF ITS LEAVES AND ASKS, "WATER?"
113	THE HINGES ARE QUITE THOROUGHLY RUSTED NOW AND WON'T BUDGE.
114	THE OIL HAS FREED UP THE HINGES SO THAT THE DOOR WILL NOW MOVE,
114	ALTHOUGH IT REQUIRES SOME EFFORT.
115	THE PLANT HAS EXCEPTIONALLY DEEP ROOTS AND CANNOT BE PULLED FREE.
116	THE DWARVES' KNIVES VANISH AS THEY STRIKE THE WALLS OF THE CAVE.
117	SOMETHING YOU'RE CARRYING WON'T FIT THROUGH THE TUNNEL WITH YOU.
117	YOU'D BEST TAKE INVENTORY AND DROP SOMETHING.
118	YOU CAN'T FIT THIS FIVE-FOOT CLAM THROUGH THAT LITTLE PASSAGE!
119	YOU CAN'T FIT THIS FIVE-FOOT OYSTER THROUGH THAT LITTLE PASSAGE!
120	I ADVISE YOU TO PUT DOWN THE CLAM BEFORE OPENING IT.  >STRAIN!<
121	I ADVISE YOU TO PUT DOWN THE OYSTER BEFORE OPENING IT.  >WRENCH!<
122	YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING STRONG ENOUGH TO OPEN THE CLAM.
123	YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING STRONG ENOUGH TO OPEN THE OYSTER.
124	A GLISTENING PEARL FALLS OUT OF THE CLAM AND ROLLS AWAY.  GOODNESS,
124	THIS MUST REALLY BE AN OYSTER.  (I NEVER WAS VERY GOOD AT IDENTIFYING
124	BIVALVES.)  WHATEVER IT IS, IT HAS NOW SNAPPED SHUT AGAIN.
125	THE OYSTER CREAKS OPEN, REVEALING NOTHING BUT OYSTER INSIDE.  IT
125	PROMPTLY SNAPS SHUT AGAIN.
126	YOU HAVE CRAWLED AROUND IN SOME LITTLE HOLES AND FOUND YOUR WAY
126	BLOCKED BY A RECENT CAVE-IN.  YOU ARE NOW BACK IN THE MAIN PASSAGE.
127	THERE ARE FAINT RUSTLING NOISES FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND YOU.
128	OUT FROM THE SHADOWS BEHIND YOU POUNCES A BEARDED PIRATE!  "HAR, HAR,"
128	HE CHORTLES, "I'LL JUST TAKE ALL THIS BOOTY AND HIDE IT AWAY WITH ME
128	CHEST DEEP IN THE MAZE!"  HE SNATCHES YOUR TREASURE AND VANISHES INTO
128	THE GLOOM.
129	A SEPULCHRAL VOICE REVERBERATING THROUGH THE CAVE, SAYS, "CAVE CLOSING
129	SOON.  ALL ADVENTURERS EXIT IMMEDIATELY THROUGH MAIN OFFICE."
130	A MYSTERIOUS RECORDED VOICE GROANS INTO LIFE AND ANNOUNCES:
130	   "THIS EXIT IS CLOSED.  PLEASE LEAVE VIA MAIN OFFICE."
131	IT LOOKS AS THOUGH YOU'RE DEAD.  WELL, SEEING AS HOW IT'S SO CLOSE TO
131	CLOSING TIME ANYWAY, I THINK WE'LL JUST CALL IT A DAY.
132	THE SEPULCHRAL VOICE ENTONES, "THE CAVE IS NOW CLOSED."  AS THE ECHOES
132	FADE, THERE IS A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT (AND A SMALL PUFF OF ORANGE
132	SMOKE). . . .    AS YOUR EYES REFOCUS, YOU LOOK AROUND AND FIND...
133	THERE IS A LOUD EXPLOSION, AND A TWENTY-FOOT HOLE APPEARS IN THE FAR
133	WALL, BURYING THE DWARVES IN THE RUBBLE.  YOU MARCH THROUGH THE HOLE
133	AND FIND YOURSELF IN THE MAIN OFFICE, WHERE A CHEERING BAND OF
133	FRIENDLY ELVES CARRY THE CONQUERING ADVENTURER OFF INTO THE SUNSET.
134	THERE IS A LOUD EXPLOSION, AND A TWENTY-FOOT HOLE APPEARS IN THE FAR
134	WALL, BURYING THE SNAKES IN THE RUBBLE.  A RIVER OF MOLTEN LAVA POURS
134	IN THROUGH THE HOLE, DESTROYING EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH, INCLUDING YOU!
135	THERE IS A LOUD EXPLOSION, AND YOU ARE SUDDENLY SPLASHED ACROSS THE
135	WALLS OF THE ROOM.
136	THE RESULTING RUCKUS HAS AWAKENED THE DWARVES.  THERE ARE NOW SEVERAL
136	THREATENING LITTLE DWARVES IN THE ROOM WITH YOU!  MOST OF THEM THROW
136	KNIVES AT YOU!  ALL OF THEM GET YOU!
137	OH, LEAVE THE POOR UNHAPPY BIRD ALONE.
138	I DARESAY WHATEVER YOU WANT IS AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.
139	I DON'T KNOW THE WORD "STOP".  USE "QUIT" IF YOU WANT TO GIVE UP.
140	YOU CAN'T GET THERE FROM HERE.
141	YOU ARE BEING FOLLOWED BY A VERY LARGE, TAME BEAR.
142	IF YOU WANT TO END YOUR ADVENTURE EARLY, SAY "QUIT".  TO SUSPEND YOUR
142	ADVENTURE SUCH THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE LATER, SAY "SUSPEND" (OR "PAUSE"
142	OR "SAVE").  TO SEE WHAT HOURS THE CAVE IS NORMALLY OPEN, SAY "HOURS".
142	TO SEE HOW WELL YOU'RE DOING, SAY "SCORE".  TO GET FULL CREDIT FOR A
142	TREASURE, YOU MUST HAVE LEFT IT SAFELY IN THE BUILDING, THOUGH YOU GET
142	PARTIAL CREDIT JUST FOR LOCATING IT.  YOU LOSE POINTS FOR GETTING
142	KILLED, OR FOR QUITTING, THOUGH THE FORMER COSTS YOU MORE.  THERE ARE
142	ALSO POINTS BASED ON HOW MUCH (IF ANY) OF THE CAVE YOU'VE MANAGED TO
142	EXPLORE; IN PARTICULAR, THERE IS A LARGE BONUS JUST FOR GETTING IN (TO
142	DISTINGUISH THE BEGINNERS FROM THE REST OF THE PACK), AND THERE ARE
142	OTHER WAYS TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME OF THE MORE
142	HARROWING SECTIONS.  IF YOU THINK YOU'VE FOUND ALL THE TREASURES, JUST
142	KEEP EXPLORING FOR A WHILE.  IF NOTHING INTERESTING HAPPENS, YOU
142	HAVEN'T FOUND THEM ALL YET.  IF SOMETHING INTERESTING *DOES* HAPPEN,
142	IT MEANS YOU'RE GETTING A BONUS AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GARNER MANY
142	MORE POINTS IN THE MASTER'S SECTION.  I MAY OCCASIONALLY OFFER HINTS
142	IF YOU SEEM TO BE HAVING TROUBLE.  IF I DO, I'LL WARN YOU IN ADVANCE
142	HOW MUCH IT WILL AFFECT YOUR SCORE TO ACCEPT THE HINTS.  FINALLY, TO
142	SAVE PAPER, YOU MAY SPECIFY "BRIEF", WHICH TELLS ME NEVER TO REPEAT
142	THE FULL DESCRIPTION OF A PLACE UNLESS YOU EXPLICITLY ASK ME TO.
143	DO YOU INDEED WISH TO QUIT NOW?
144	THERE IS NOTHING HERE WITH WHICH TO FILL THE VASE.
145	THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE HAS DELICATELY SHATTERED THE VASE.
146	IT IS BEYOND YOUR POWER TO DO THAT.
147	I DON'T KNOW HOW.
148	IT IS TOO FAR UP FOR YOU TO REACH.
149	YOU KILLED A LITTLE DWARF.  THE BODY VANISHES IN A CLOUD OF GREASY
149	BLACK SMOKE.
150	THE SHELL IS VERY STRONG AND IS IMPERVIOUS TO ATTACK.
151	WHAT'S THE MATTER, CAN'T YOU READ?  NOW YOU'D BEST START OVER.
152	THE AXE BOUNCES HARMLESSLY OFF THE DRAGON'S THICK SCALES.
153	THE DRAGON LOOKS RATHER NASTY.  YOU'D BEST NOT TRY TO GET BY.
154	THE LITTLE BIRD ATTACKS THE GREEN DRAGON, AND IN AN ASTOUNDING FLURRY
154	GETS BURNT TO A CINDER.  THE ASHES BLOW AWAY.
155	ON WHAT?
156	OKAY, FROM NOW ON I'LL ONLY DESCRIBE A PLACE IN FULL THE FIRST TIME
156	YOU COME TO IT.  TO GET THE FULL DESCRIPTION, SAY "LOOK".
157	TROLLS ARE CLOSE RELATIVES WITH THE ROCKS AND HAVE SKIN AS TOUGH AS
157	THAT OF A RHINOCEROS.  THE TROLL FENDS OFF YOUR BLOWS EFFORTLESSLY.
158	THE TROLL DEFTLY CATCHES THE AXE, EXAMINES IT CAREFULLY, AND TOSSES IT
158	BACK, DECLARING, "GOOD WORKMANSHIP, BUT IT'S NOT VALUABLE ENOUGH."
159	THE TROLL CATCHES YOUR TREASURE AND SCURRIES AWAY OUT OF SIGHT.
160	THE TROLL REFUSES TO LET YOU CROSS.
161	THERE IS NO LONGER ANY WAY ACROSS THE CHASM.
162	JUST AS YOU REACH THE OTHER SIDE, THE BRIDGE BUCKLES BENEATH THE
162	WEIGHT OF THE BEAR, WHICH WAS STILL FOLLOWING YOU AROUND.  YOU
162	SCRABBLE DESPERATELY FOR SUPPORT, BUT AS THE BRIDGE COLLAPSES YOU
162	STUMBLE BACK AND FALL INTO THE CHASM.
163	THE BEAR LUMBERS TOWARD THE TROLL, WHO LETS OUT A STARTLED SHRIEK AND
163	SCURRIES AWAY.  THE BEAR SOON GIVES UP THE PURSUIT AND WANDERS BACK.
164	THE AXE MISSES AND LANDS NEAR THE BEAR WHERE YOU CAN'T GET AT IT.
165	WITH WHAT?  YOUR BARE HANDS?  AGAINST *HIS* BEAR HANDS??
166	THE BEAR IS CONFUSED; HE ONLY WANTS TO BE YOUR FRIEND.
167	FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, THE POOR THING IS ALREADY DEAD!
168	THE BEAR EAGERLY WOLFS DOWN YOUR FOOD, AFTER WHICH HE SEEMS TO CALM
168	DOWN CONSIDERABLY AND EVEN BECOMES RATHER FRIENDLY.
169	THE BEAR IS STILL CHAINED TO THE WALL.
170	THE CHAIN IS STILL LOCKED.
171	THE CHAIN IS NOW UNLOCKED.
172	THE CHAIN IS NOW LOCKED.
173	THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO WHICH THE CHAIN CAN BE LOCKED.
174	THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO EAT.
175	DO YOU WANT THE HINT?
176	DO YOU NEED HELP GETTING OUT OF THE MAZE?
177	YOU CAN MAKE THE PASSAGES LOOK LESS ALIKE BY DROPPING THINGS.
178	ARE YOU TRYING TO EXPLORE BEYOND THE PLOVER ROOM?
179	THERE IS A WAY TO EXPLORE THAT REGION WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT
179	FALLING INTO A PIT.  NONE OF THE OBJECTS AVAILABLE IS IMMEDIATELY
179	USEFUL IN DISCOVERING THE SECRET.
180	DO YOU NEED HELP GETTING OUT OF HERE?
181	DON'T GO WEST.
182	GLUTTONY IS NOT ONE OF THE TROLL'S VICES.  AVARICE, HOWEVER, IS.
183	YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM.  YOU'D BEST START WRAPPING THIS UP, UNLESS
183	YOU CAN FIND SOME FRESH BATTERIES.  I SEEM TO RECALL THERE'S A VENDING
183	MACHINE IN THE MAZE.  BRING SOME COINS WITH YOU.
184	YOUR LAMP HAS RUN OUT OF POWER.
185	THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT IN WANDERING AROUND OUT HERE, AND YOU CAN'T
185	EXPLORE THE CAVE WITHOUT A LAMP.  SO LET'S JUST CALL IT A DAY.
186	THERE ARE FAINT RUSTLING NOISES FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND YOU.  AS YOU
186	TURN TOWARD THEM, THE BEAM OF YOUR LAMP FALLS ACROSS A BEARDED PIRATE.
186	HE IS CARRYING A LARGE CHEST.  "SHIVER ME TIMBERS!" HE CRIES, "I'VE
186	BEEN SPOTTED!  I'D BEST HIE MESELF OFF TO THE MAZE TO HIDE ME CHEST!"
186	WITH THAT, HE VANISHES INTO THE GLOOM.
187	YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM.  YOU'D BEST GO BACK FOR THOSE BATTERIES.
188	YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM.  I'M TAKING THE LIBERTY OF REPLACING THE
188	BATTERIES.
189	YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM, AND YOU'RE OUT OF SPARE BATTERIES.  YOU'D
189	BEST START WRAPPING THIS UP.
190	I'M AFRAID THE MAGAZINE IS WRITTEN IN DWARVISH.
191	"THIS IS NOT THE MAZE WHERE THE PIRATE LEAVES HIS TREASURE CHEST."
192	HMMM, THIS LOOKS LIKE A CLUE, WHICH MEANS IT'LL COST YOU 10 POINTS TO
192	READ IT.  SHOULD I GO AHEAD AND READ IT ANYWAY?
193	IT SAYS, "THERE IS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS PLACE, SUCH THAT ONE
193	OF THE WORDS I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN NOW HAS A NEW EFFECT."
194	IT SAYS THE SAME THING IT DID BEFORE.
195	I'M AFRAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
196	"CONGRATULATIONS ON BRINGING LIGHT INTO THE DARK-ROOM!"
197	YOU STRIKE THE MIRROR A RESOUNDING BLOW, WHEREUPON IT SHATTERS INTO A
197	MYRIAD TINY FRAGMENTS.
198	YOU HAVE TAKEN THE VASE AND HURLED IT DELICATELY TO THE GROUND.
199	YOU PROD THE NEAREST DWARF, WHO WAKES UP GRUMPILY, TAKES ONE LOOK AT
199	YOU, CURSES, AND GRABS FOR HIS AXE.
200	IS THIS ACCEPTABLE?
201	THERE'S NO POINT IN SUSPENDING A DEMONSTRATION GAME.

1	A LARGE CLOUD OF GREEN SMOKE APPEARS IN FRONT OF YOU.  IT CLEARS AWAY
1	TO REVEAL A TALL WIZARD, CLOTHED IN GREY.  HE FIXES YOU WITH A STEELY
1	GLARE AND DECLARES, "THIS ADVENTURE HAS LASTED TOO LONG."  WITH THAT
1	HE MAKES A SINGLE PASS OVER YOU WITH HIS HANDS, AND EVERYTHING AROUND
1	YOU FADES AWAY INTO A GREY NOTHINGNESS.
