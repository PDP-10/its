	Aww, gee... I'm sorry... I didn't realy mean it. I was just
asking questions pertaining to popes and bears and woods, and you
got all excited... Some AI program you are if you don't know what
religion a bear is or where the Pope ... Ahem... As I was saying,
I'm sorry and I will never do it again.

    Trust in the LORD with all your heart and HE will acknowledge
    and HE will light the way.


    This prayer has been sent to you for good luck.  The original 
    copy is from the Netherlands.  It has been around the world
    nine times.  The luck has now been brought to you.  You will 
    receive good luck within four days of receiving this letter, 
    provided in turn, you send it back out.  DO NOT SEND MONEY, FOR
    FAITH HAS NO PRICE.  Do not keep this letter.  It must leave your
    hands within 96 hours after you receive it.  An RAF officer
    received $70,000.  Joe Ellito received $450,000 and lost it
    because he broke the chain.  While in the Phillipines, General
    Welch lost his wife four days after he received this letter.  He
    failed to circulate the prayer.  However, before his death, he 
    received $775,000.  Please send 20 copies and see what happens
    to you on the fourth day.  This chain comes from Venezuela, and
    was written by Saul Anthony deOziof, a missionary from South
    America.  I, myself, forward it to you.  Since the chain must
    make the tour of the world, you must make 20 identical copies
    to this one.  Sned it to your friends, parents, or associates.
    After a few days you will get a suprise.  This is true even 
    if you are not superstitious.  Take note of the following. 
    Constantine Dino received the chain in 1953.  He asked 
    his secretary to make 20 copies and send them.  A few days later,
    he won a lottery for $2,000,000 in his country.  Carlo Caditt,
    an office employee, received the chain.  He forgot it and a few
    days later he lost his job.  He found the chain letter and sent
    it to 20 people.  Five days later he got an even better job.
    Dolon Fairchild received the chain and not believing it, threw 
    it away.  Nine days later he died.  For no reason whatsoever should 
    this chain be broken.  Remember, SEND NO MONEY.


    Please do not ignore this.  IT WORKS!

Trust in the LORD with all your heart and HE will acknowledge
and HE will light the way.


This prayer has been sent to you for good luck.  The original 
copy is from the Netherlands.  It has been around the world
nine times.  The luck has now been brought to you.  You will 
receive good luck within four days of receiving this letter, 
provided in turn, you send it back out.  DO NOT SEND MONEY, FOR
FAITH HAS NO PRICE.  Do not keep this letter.  It must leave your
hands within 96 hours after you receive it.  An RAF officer
received $70,000.  Joe Ellito received $450,000 and lost it
because he broke the chain.  While in the Phillipines, General
Welch lost his wife four days after he received this letter.  He
failed to circulate the prayer.  However, before his death, he 
received $775,000.  Please send 20 copies and see what happens
to you on the fourth day.  This chain comes from Venezuela, and
was written by Saul Anthony deOziof, a missionary from South
America.  I, myself, forward it to you.  Since the chain must
make the tour of the world, you must make 20 identical copies
to this one.  Sned it to your friends, parents, or associates.
After a few days you will get a suprise.  This is true even 
if you are not superstitious.  Take note of the following. 
Constantine Dino received the chain in 1953.  He asked 
his secretary to make 20 copies and send them.  A few days later,
he won a lottery for $2,000,000 in his country.  Carlo Caditt,
an office employee, received the chain.  He forgot it and a few
days later he lost his job.  He found the chain letter and sent
it to 20 people.  Five days later he got an even better job.
Dolon Fairchild received the chain and not believing it, threw 
it away.  Nine days later he died.  For no reason whatsoever should 
this chain be broken.  Remember, SEND NO MONEY.


Please do not ignore this.  IT WORKS!

Danny,

The first time I saw this message today, I thought it was kinda funny, but I
foresaw trouble in a finite universe of potential recipients.

This just could become known as the message that led to the institution of
postage charges for electronic mail.

Trust in the LORD with all your heart and HE will acknowledge
and HE will light the way.


This prayer has been sent to you for good luck.  The original 
copy is from the Netherlands.  It has been around the world
nine times.  The luck has now been brought to you.  You will 
receive good luck within four days of receiving this letter, 
provided in turn, you send it back out.  DO NOT SEND MONEY, FOR
FAITH HAS NO PRICE.  Do not keep this letter.  It must leave your
hands within 96 hours after you receive it.  An RAF officer
received $70,000.  Joe Ellito received $450,000 and lost it
because he broke the chain.  While in the Phillipines, General
Welch lost his wife four days after he received this letter.  He
failed to circulate the prayer.  However, before his death, he 
received $775,000.  Please send 20 copies and see what happens
to you on the fourth day.  This chain comes from Venezuela, and
was written by Saul Anthony deOziof, a missionary from South
America.  I, myself, forward it to you.  Since the chain must
make the tour of the world, you must make 20 identical copies
to this one.  Sned it to your friends, parents, or associates.
After a few days you will get a suprise.  This is true even 
if you are not superstitious.  Take note of the following. 
Constantine Dino received the chain in 1953.  He asked 
his secretary to make 20 copies and send them.  A few days later,
he won a lottery for $2,000,000 in his country.  Carlo Caditt,
an office employee, received the chain.  He forgot it and a few
days later he lost his job.  He found the chain letter and sent
it to 20 people.  Five days later he got an even better job.
Dolon Fairchild received the chain and not believing it, threw 
it away.  Nine days later he died.  For no reason whatsoever should 
this chain be broken.  Remember, SEND NO MONEY.


Please do not ignore this.  IT WORKS!

Danny,

The first time I saw this message today, I thought it was kinda funny, but I
foresaw trouble in a finite universe of potential recipients.

This just could become known as the message that led to the institution of
postage charges for electronic mail.

	Just in case you folks were wondering how far your message got.  May I
suggest sending 5 copies back to the originators of the message.  I'm sure that
will bring megabytes of good luck.

	This is message 3 of 5.

    Trust in the LORD with all your heart and HE will acknowledge
    and HE will light the way.


    This prayer has been sent to you for good luck.  The original 
    copy is from the Netherlands.  It has been around the world
    nine times.  The luck has now been brought to you.  You will 
    receive good luck within four days of receiving this letter, 
    provided in turn, you send it back out.  DO NOT SEND MONEY, FOR
    FAITH HAS NO PRICE.  Do not keep this letter.  It must leave your
    hands within 96 hours after you receive it.  An RAF officer
    received $70,000.  Joe Ellito received $450,000 and lost it
    because he broke the chain.  While in the Phillipines, General
    Welch lost his wife four days after he received this letter.  He
    failed to circulate the prayer.  However, before his death, he 
    received $775,000.  Please send 20 copies and see what happens
    to you on the fourth day.  This chain comes from Venezuela, and
    was written by Saul Anthony deOziof, a missionary from South
    America.  I, myself, forward it to you.  Since the chain must
    make the tour of the world, you must make 20 identical copies
    to this one.  Sned it to your friends, parents, or associates.
    After a few days you will get a suprise.  This is true even 
    if you are not superstitious.  Take note of the following. 
    Constantine Dino received the chain in 1953.  He asked 
    his secretary to make 20 copies and send them.  A few days later,
    he won a lottery for $2,000,000 in his country.  Carlo Caditt,
    an office employee, received the chain.  He forgot it and a few
    days later he lost his job.  He found the chain letter and sent
    it to 20 people.  Five days later he got an even better job.
    Dolon Fairchild received the chain and not believing it, threw 
    it away.  Nine days later he died.  For no reason whatsoever should 
    this chain be broken.  Remember, SEND NO MONEY.


    Please do not ignore this.  IT WORKS!

Danny,

The first time I saw this message today, I thought it was kinda funny, but I
foresaw trouble in a finite universe of potential recipients.

This just could become known as the message that led to the institution of
postage charges for electronic mail.

	Just in case you folks were wondering how far your message got.  May I
suggest sending 5 copies back to the originators of the message.  I'm sure that
will bring megabytes of good luck.

    Trust in the LORD with all your heart and HE will acknowledge
    and HE will light the way.


    This prayer has been sent to you for good luck.  The original 
    copy is from the Netherlands.  It has been around the world
    nine times.  The luck has now been brought to you.  You will 
    receive good luck within four days of receiving this letter, 
    provided in turn, you send it back out.  DO NOT SEND MONEY, FOR
    FAITH HAS NO PRICE.  Do not keep this letter.  It must leave your
    hands within 96 hours after you receive it.  An RAF officer
    received $70,000.  Joe Ellito received $450,000 and lost it
    because he broke the chain.  While in the Phillipines, General
    Welch lost his wife four days after he received this letter.  He
    failed to circulate the prayer.  However, before his death, he 
    received $775,000.  Please send 20 copies and see what happens
    to you on the fourth day.  This chain comes from Venezuela, and
    was written by Saul Anthony deOziof, a missionary from South
    America.  I, myself, forward it to you.  Since the chain must
    make the tour of the world, you must make 20 identical copies
    to this one.  Sned it to your friends, parents, or associates.
    After a few days you will get a suprise.  This is true even 
    if you are not superstitious.  Take note of the following. 
    Constantine Dino received the chain in 1953.  He asked 
    his secretary to make 20 copies and send them.  A few days later,
    he won a lottery for $2,000,000 in his country.  Carlo Caditt,
    an office employee, received the chain.  He forgot it and a few
    days later he lost his job.  He found the chain letter and sent
    it to 20 people.  Five days later he got an even better job.
    Dolon Fairchild received the chain and not believing it, threw 
    it away.  Nine days later he died.  For no reason whatsoever should 
    this chain be broken.  Remember, SEND NO MONEY.


    Please do not ignore this.  IT WORKS!

Danny,

The first time I saw this message today, I thought it was kinda funny, but I
foresaw trouble in a finite universe of potential recipients.

This just could become known as the message that led to the institution of
postage charges for electronic mail.

	Just in case you folks were wondering how far your message got.  May I
suggest sending 5 copies back to the originators of the message.  I'm sure that
will bring megabytes of good luck.

    Trust in the LORD with all your heart and HE will acknowledge
    and HE will light the way.


    This prayer has been sent to you for good luck.  The original 
    copy is from the Netherlands.  It has been around the world
    nine times.  The luck has now been brought to you.  You will 
    receive good luck within four days of receiving this letter, 
    provided in turn, you send it back out.  DO NOT SEND MONEY, FOR
    FAITH HAS NO PRICE.  Do not keep this letter.  It must leave your
    hands within 96 hours after you receive it.  An RAF officer
    received $70,000.  Joe Ellito received $450,000 and lost it
    because he broke the chain.  While in the Phillipines, General
    Welch lost his wife four days after he received this letter.  He
    failed to circulate the prayer.  However, before his death, he 
    received $775,000.  Please send 20 copies and see what happens
    to you on the fourth day.  This chain comes from Venezuela, and
    was written by Saul Anthony deOziof, a missionary from South
    America.  I, myself, forward it to you.  Since the chain must
    make the tour of the world, you must make 20 identical copies
    to this one.  Sned it to your friends, parents, or associates.
    After a few days you will get a suprise.  This is true even 
    if you are not superstitious.  Take note of the following. 
    Constantine Dino received the chain in 1953.  He asked 
    his secretary to make 20 copies and send them.  A few days later,
    he won a lottery for $2,000,000 in his country.  Carlo Caditt,
    an office employee, received the chain.  He forgot it and a few
    days later he lost his job.  He found the chain letter and sent
    it to 20 people.  Five days later he got an even better job.
    Dolon Fairchild received the chain and not believing it, threw 
    it away.  Nine days later he died.  For no reason whatsoever should 
    this chain be broken.  Remember, SEND NO MONEY.


    Please do not ignore this.  IT WORKS!

Danny,

The first time I saw this message today, I thought it was kinda funny, but I
foresaw trouble in a finite universe of potential recipients.

This just could become known as the message that led to the institution of
postage charges for electronic mail.

Trust in the LORD with all your heart and HE will acknowledge
and HE will light the way.


This prayer has been sent to you for good luck.  The original 
copy is from the Netherlands.  It has been around the world
nine times.  The luck has now been brought to you.  You will 
receive good luck within four days of receiving this letter, 
provided in turn, you send it back out.  DO NOT SEND MONEY, FOR
FAITH HAS NO PRICE.  Do not keep this letter.  It must leave your
hands within 96 hours after you receive it.  An RAF officer
received $70,000.  Joe Ellito received $450,000 and lost it
because he broke the chain.  While in the Phillipines, General
Welch lost his wife four days after he received this letter.  He
failed to circulate the prayer.  However, before his death, he 
received $775,000.  Please send 20 copies and see what happens
to you on the fourth day.  This chain comes from Venezuela, and
was written by Saul Anthony deOziof, a missionary from South
America.  I, myself, forward it to you.  Since the chain must
make the tour of the world, you must make 20 identical copies
to this one.  Sned it to your friends, parents, or associates.
After a few days you will get a suprise.  This is true even 
if you are not superstitious.  Take note of the following. 
Constantine Dino received the chain in 1953.  He asked 
his secretary to make 20 copies and send them.  A few days later,
he won a lottery for $2,000,000 in his country.  Carlo Caditt,
an office employee, received the chain.  He forgot it and a few
days later he lost his job.  He found the chain letter and sent
it to 20 people.  Five days later he got an even better job.
Dolon Fairchild received the chain and not believing it, threw 
it away.  Nine days later he died.  For no reason whatsoever should 
this chain be broken.  Remember, SEND NO MONEY.


Please do not ignore this.  IT WORKS!

Subject: Chain letter
To: JWagner at OFFICE-2
cc: ANIMAL at MIT-MC

Hello.
 Today I recieved my "chain letter".
 Now, normally, I appreciate mail from people I don't know.
 However, this chain letter was a great dissapointment.
 Not only is it misuse of government funds, for which the entire
forwarding list on the letter could be fined and imprisoned, but
half the machines it was sent to djust *don't* have the disk space
(including MIT-AI). 
 What that chain letter was was childish, wasteful, boring, and
irritating. I would like to know *where* you got my name, and
*why* you put it on the letter. Furthermore, I would request
that you send another letter to the twenty people you sent it
to saying *not* to reforward it. I myself am not forwarding it,
and am saving it on my disk in case I fel like gettign the fools
and twits (yourself included) who did this thing.
				
				Shade and Sweet Water,
				Joseph D. Turner

Trust in the LORD with all your heart and HE will acknowledge
and HE will light the way.


This prayer has been sent to you for good luck.  The original 
copy is from the Netherlands.  It has been around the world
nine times.  The luck has now been brought to you.  You will 
receive good luck within four days of receiving this letter, 
provided in turn, you send it back out.  DO NOT SEND MONEY, FOR
FAITH HAS NO PRICE.  Do not keep this letter.  It must leave your
hands within 96 hours after you receive it.  An RAF officer
received $70,000.  Joe Ellito received $450,000 and lost it
because he broke the chain.  While in the Phillipines, General
Welch lost his wife four days after he received this letter.  He
failed to circulate the prayer.  However, before his death, he 
received $775,000.  Please send 20 copies and see what happens
to you on the fourth day.  This chain comes from Venezuela, and
was written by Saul Anthony deOziof, a missionary from South
America.  I, myself, forward it to you.  Since the chain must
make the tour of the world, you must make 20 identical copies
to this one.  Sned it to your friends, parents, or associates.
After a few days you will get a suprise.  This is true even 
if you are not superstitious.  Take note of the following. 
Constantine Dino received the chain in 1953.  He asked 
his secretary to make 20 copies and send them.  A few days later,
he won a lottery for $2,000,000 in his country.  Carlo Caditt,
an office employee, received the chain.  He forgot it and a few
days later he lost his job.  He found the chain letter and sent
it to 20 people.  Five days later he got an even better job.
Dolon Fairchild received the chain and not believing it, threw 
it away.  Nine days later he died.  For no reason whatsoever should 
this chain be broken.  Remember, SEND NO MONEY.


Please do not ignore this.  IT WORKS!
