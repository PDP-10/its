-- Files which support the BLOCKS micro-world


  BLOCKP >  Microplanner code for essentially all the functions of the
             BLOCKS world. - there are some supplementary materials at the
             end of the dictionary and data files

  BLOCKL >  LISP code to support the microplanner code of BLOCKS. In particular
             this includes the routine for finding space on an object and
             for maintaining the history list.

  DATA >    The initial contents (assertions) of the BLOCKS world's
             microplanner data base. Plus a few addittional function calls
             for initializing all other aspects of the micro-world.

  PLNR 180  This is a complete EXPR code version of MICROPLANNER. Calls to
             MICROPLANNER in SHRDLU are always done by calling the function
             THVAL2, contained in the semantics files, rather than the usual
             call to THVAL. PLNR 180 can be loaded independantly and run 
             as a toplevel MICROPLANNER if desired. A compiled version of
             the files is availlable as PLNR FASL on SHRDLU, and TS PLNR on
             SYS should point to a core dump of a toplevel MICROPLANNER

  THTRAC 18 This is a file of tracing routines designed for tracing opperations
             during the evaluation of MICROPLANNER code





--  Toplevel files for the language understanding system --


  SYSCOM >  Contains the toplevel function SHRDLU as well as usefull extentions
             to LISP, special printing functions, break functions, garbage
             collection functions etc.

  MORPHO >  Does all the morphological analysis required in the system via
             the function ETAOIN which is also the function called by SHRDLU
             to read in a user's sentence from the console.

  SHOW >    This is the "Show - Tell" user package developed for use at a
             workshop at CMU in 1972. It provides a convenient way for a 
             largely naieve user to interogate and change the data structures
             used in the system. Consult the MANUAL CMU for further details

  SETUP >   A loose ends file for setting global variables, initializing
             trace routines, and setting up the initial environment. It is
             intended to be the final file read into the system before 
             making a core dump.  



--  Files concerned with syntax


  PROGMR >  This file contains all the functions that comprise the programmar
             language fro writing grammars. It expects to be entered from a
             toplevel call to PARSE as done in SHRDLU, and executes grammar
             programs via an intermediary function, APPLY-GRAMMAR, to permit
             differing opperations in the cases of compiled and intrepreted
             code.

  GINTER >  "Grammar Interpreter" - Contains the calling sequence for use when
             running an uncompiled grammar. A precompiling pass is necessary
             on grammar functions to remove extra levels of function calls
             and to incorporate the calling program used in GINTER to eliminate
             GOTO's out of scope.

  GRAMAR >  The entire syntactic recognition grammar for the system. See
             A.I. MEMO 282 "Grammar for the People" for comprehensive flowcharts
             of the functions in this file.

  DICTIO >  Specifications and entrys for all of SHRDLU's vocabulary and 
             related atomic symbols. This file contains all aspects of their
             definitions: syntax, semantics, macro-expanders, etc.



-- Semantics files --


  SMSPEC >  "Semantic Specialists"  This contains all the functions which know
             how to interpret the syntactic forms that will be found by the
             grammar: noun groups, relative clauses, pronouns, etc.. All calls
             to these functions come from the syntactic routines through the 
             function SMCALL which is in PROGMR.

  SMUTIL >  Utility routines used by all the semantic functions for building
             nodes, evaluating definitions, marker checks, backreference maintanence,
             quantifier adjusting, building MIRCOPLANNER code.

  SMASS >   Access functions that are used by the two previous files to grovel
             through their data structures while retaining their perspicuity.



-- Answering --

  NEWANS >  "new answer" Code for finding the answers to questions, absorbing
             new information, and following commands, then fromulating the
             appropriate English answers. This code is extensively interfaced
             with MICROPLANNER.




-- Documentation --

  MANUAL CMU, MANNEW >, HELP DOC, MINIH DOC

            These files are unfortunately all the documentation availlable on the
             care and feeding of the system appart from Winograd's book (which is
             far and away the best reference to the details of its opperation).
             MANUAL CMU, as its name implys, was developed for the workshop at
             CMU and it the most through overall guide. HELP DOC and MINIH DOC  
             are essentially excerpts from it which were intended as online references.
             MANNEW is grossly incomplete, but it is also the most up to date, and
             covers initial ussage of hte system.


  .INDEX >  This is a through cross-reference for all the LISP code used in the system.
             It lists functions and variables alphabeticly with listings of their
             interactions with the rest of the code (functions called, variables
             bound ...). Also of interest is the file LISP >, which alphabeticly lists
             all MACLISP functions ever invoked in the code and the functions that they
             were invoked from.



-- At the end of the directory, the files whose first names are "Z" are the origninal
    files of the system circa January 1971. They use the old list oriented data
    structures and are essentially uncommented. However they can often be of use
    when trying to see if alternate formulations of some algorithm were ever
    considered.
