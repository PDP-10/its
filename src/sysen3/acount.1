place such as inside a lab at Tech Square.  The :LOGIN command will
work for you from inside without a password.  Once you have logged
in, the only registration you need to do is run the :INQUIR program
to tell us who you are, if you have not done so already.

If you need an account for accessing the machine from outside the
laboratory, first make yourself known using INQUIR, and then send
mail to USER-ACCOUNTS asking to be fixed up.
