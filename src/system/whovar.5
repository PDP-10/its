;Notes:
;
;1.	All addresses and pointers are in PDP-11 address space.
;
;2.	KBD buffers are ringed two per channel.  While the PDP-10 is
;	emptying one, the PDP-11 can fill the other.
;
;3.	There is only one DPY buffer per channel.  When the buffer is filled
;	with negative numbers, it is free.  When the PDP-10 writes a positive
;	number in the current word: then the PDP-11 processes the data in that
;	word, sets that word to a negative number, and advances to the next word.

;
;PDP-10/PDP-11 COMMAND CHANNEL
;
;    CMDFLG	aligned on PDP-10
;		0=>buffer is free (PDP-10 can write CMDBUF)
;		positive=>command # from PDP-10 (PDP-11 can write CMDBUF)
;		negative=>affirmative reply from PDP-11 (0=>command failed)
;		PDP-10 can read CMDBUF, then must zero CMDFLG
;    CMDFL1	always 0
;    CMDBUF	each arg takes 4 bytes (1 PDP-10 word)
;
;    PDP-10/PDP-11 COMMANDS
;
;	1	video switch
;		arg1:	video switch input #  (set by PDP-10)

;;other 10-11 commuincation issues ..
;
;;go down resetting video switch vs not
;;PDP-11 indicates it has reset video switch
