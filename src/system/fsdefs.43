; 8/19/90 Due to the larger size of RP07s it was necessary to officially
; flush the DM "funny" bit.  This change only changes the comments in this
; file, but any program that interprets UFD descriptors needs to be fixed
; to not mask that bit out (as most of them currently do).  Fortunately all
; the known ITS filesystems have zeros in all their "funny" bits, so the
; change is upward compatible.

; UFD descriptor format described:
;
; Each 6-bit byte is taken in turn and used to compute a sequence of block
; numbers.  If N is the current descriptor byte, and B is the current block
; number (initially undefined), then N is interpreted as follows: 
;
;  0  Marks the end of the file description.
; 
;  1 to UDTKMX  (1 to 14)		"Take" N blocks.
;	Blocks B through B + N - 1 are the next N blocks of the file.
;	Set B := B + N .
; 
;  UDTKMX+1 to UDWPH-1  (15 to 36)	"Skip" B - UDTKMX blocks.
;	Set N := N + B - UDTKMX .
;	(ITS has been broken for years such that it never uses this
;	UFD descriptor code!)
; 
;  UDWPH  (37)				Write Place Holder
;	A noop.  Used to reserve space in directories for files that are
;	being written.  Just skip over it and read the next byte.
; 
;  40 - 77				Load address and take 1.
;	Read the next NXLBYT descriptor bytes (NXLBYT=2), N2 and N3.
;	Set B := LSH(AND(N, 37), 12.) + LSH(N2, 6) + N3 .
;	Block B is the next block in the file.
;	Set B := B + 1 .
;
; A zero length file is described as two bytes: UDWPH then 0.  UDWPH does
; not otherwise normally appear in UFD descriptions for closed files.
; Note that a legal description must use codes 40 - 77 before it can use
; any code other than UDWPH.

; Links are described as a sequence of SIXBIT characters terminated with a
; 0 byte.  The directory, first and second name are stored in order.
; The first two components are terminated with a ";" if they are less than
; 6 characters long.  ";" (73), ":" (72) and " " (0) are quoted by
; preceding them with a ":".  Some examples:
;
; Link target names:		Bytes stored in directory:
;
; 123456 123456 123456		"123456123456123456 "
; ALAN   FOO    BAR		"ALAN;FOO;BAR "
; .MAIL. NAMES  >		".MAIL.NAMES;> "
; .MAIL.  LISTS   MSGS		".MAIL.: LISTS: : MSGS "
; MOON   LUNAR  :EJ		"MOON;LUNAR;::EJ "
;
; There are a lot of illegal or wasteful possibilities for link descriptors
; ("A;B ", "A;B;C;D ", ":A;:B;:C ", etc.), which is suprising since
; somebody was clearly trying to compress them into as few bytes as
; possible.

; Here is the pre 8/19/90 comment describing UFD descriptors:
; 
; 	;UFD DESCRIPTORS
; 	;0 => FREE  1-UDTKMX => TAKE NEXT N
; 	;UDTKMX+1 THRU UDWPH-1 => SKIP N-UDTKMX AND TAKE ONE
; 	;UDWPH => WRITE-PLACE-HOLDER
; 	;40 BIT SET => LOAD ADDRESS.  LOWER 5 BITS PLUS NEXT NXLBYT (2)
; 	;  CHARS (17 BITS IN ALL)
; 	;40 BIT & 20 BIT => "FUNNY" BLOCK IF DMDSK.  WHAT IS THIS, ANYWAY?
; 	;END BY 0
; 
; 	;IF LINK DESCR
; 	;6 CHAR OR UNTIL ; = SYS NAME.  MUST HAVE NO CHAR = 0 IN THIS OR
; 	; NEXT 2 NAMES 
; 	;NEXT CHAR QUOTED BY : (FOR NAMES WITH : OR ;)
; 	;NEXT CHAR N1
; 	;NEXT CHAR N2
; 	;END BY 0
